puzzling !
typhoon hit Taiwan , flooding happened everywhere , the wind came , trees fell , even houses collapsed , the Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration , Airport personnel , how to leave two earth scrapers on the airport runway , you do not worry , the typhoon will scrape earth scrapers , fly to another run Does the road cause more and more terrible casualties ?
why don 't the shovels move ? this is an airport , not an ordinary highway . the shovels stay there . is anyone working ?
it is said that these two excavators have been on the runway of the airport for a long time . why ?
even more ridiculous is that the runway can not be used , the entrance in front of the unexpectedly not surrounded , this even pupils know the truth , but the Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration does not understand , this is completely irresponsible !
especially puzzling things , control crew also shirked responsibility , can not see the wrong runway of Xinhang Flight 006 .
since you can 't see clearly , why do we need to let the plane take off ?
this completely inprofessional person is simply not qualified for the job .
the problem of lighting is even more unforgivable .
since the runway is not available , why should we turn on the lights ?
broadcasting runway numbers is even more childish , with 5 left , 5 right , this confusing number , why not use 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and so on .
the airport represents the wisdom of leaders of a country and a region .
this time , the Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration ( Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration ) has also spoken out loud , refused to admit mistakes , refused to assume responsibility , and pushed everything to the new pilots . may I ask the Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration ( Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration ) how do you face the grievances of the victims and how do you face international public opinion ?

archaeologists claim that a secret workshop , believed to be Leonardo Da Vinci 's work on aircraft and other pioneering sciences , was found in a former monastery and now in the building of the Italian Military Geographic Academy near Santissima Annunziata Cathedral in central Florence , Italy . it may also be the " birthplace " of Leonardo Da Vinci 's masterpiece Monroe Lisa .

he had another friend , B , who told him what kind of kindness was .
he knew her from the letter she wrote .
the letter she wrote must be : sir .
..
and he felt satisfied when he saw such an elegant beginning .
and his A just showed him the beginning , and then it was something that two people could share .
however , the word " Jun " is enough to make him think about it for a long time .
in his opinion , although she was not as good as Eileen Chang , Lu Xiaoman also set unusual girls .

Xinhua News Agency , Macao , November 21 ( Reporter Li Jie ) Macao 's health and medical departments have recently actively carried out the prevention of infectious diseases , and achieved remarkable results .
people from the Macao Health Bureau said that polio , leprosy and smallpox are now extinct in Macao , and the incidence of measles , tuberculosis and hepatitis has been well controlled .
prevention of poliomyelitis has been a focus of vaccination in Macao for many years . children under 13 years of age can be vaccinated free of charge in government health centers and hospitals . workers also go to school to provide door-to-door services . as a result , vaccination coverage in Macao has been restored for many years . the rate has remained above 90 % .
on October 29 this year , Macao was officially recognized by the World Health Organization as a polio eradication area , five years ahead of the World Health Organization 's schedule for global polio eradication in 2005 .
the incidence of tuberculosis in Macau had once rebounded a few years ago , health and medical departments have improved and strengthened prevention , and the annual incidence has now dropped to about one thousandth .
hepatitis is relatively high in Australia , and the health sector has taken both publicity and education measures to prevent the disease .
on the one hand , to mobilize residents 'awareness of disease prevention , on the other hand , to vaccinate children under the age of 12 to reduce the number of vulnerable groups , so that the incidence of stable control at a low level .
it ended . as many people expected , Bush , as many people feared , was re elected .
personally , I think the next four years will be a very quiet four years .
the situation in Iraq , the Korean Peninsula , the Iranian nuclear issue and the Taiwan Strait crisis will occasionally stimulate the nerves of all walks of life .
in some ways , Bush and Koizumi are very similar in many ways .
for example , they like to talk freely , for example , there are politicians arrogant , individualism is very clear .
on the one hand , because their country is economically developed and militarily strong ; on the other hand , China , the only country with a totally different ideology from the United States , is too backward .
the extreme imbalance between the East and the West , the Eastern culture , " people do not offend me , I do not offend " mentality can not affect the Western interests above the aggressive culture .
how will China react if the US is to send troops to North Korea in the next four years ?
there are often articles that say : China and the United States have great interests in each other , so the United States will not interfere in Taiwan affairs .
then , if the United States meddle in the Korean Peninsula .
China has no ability to fight with the US , at least not yet .
Bush is a man who disregards the rules of the game , and it is entirely possible that one day he will bypass the United Nations and go straight to North Korea .
the Korean Peninsula will never be as intractable as Iraq , if it excludes China .
at the end of World War I , I don 't think many people could have predicted World War II , because they couldn 't see the history they were deducing , which was later called World War II .
we can 't predict when the Third World War will come , to be honest , because our world is dominated by a few people .
perhaps history will repeat , and the history books will record that the American dictator George W. Bush , under the pretext of the nuclear issue , United Japan to launch a war of aggression against North Korea .
China was forced to enter the war , and the eastern hemisphere became the main battleground for the Third World War .
no one can predict it .
until later generations , like us , opened history books and were forced to wait for the next World War in discussions of democracy and centralization .

( London , AFP ) British pharmaceutical giants Glaxo Wellcome and Smith Kline Beecham , after several twists and turns , finally reached a merger agreement yesterday , becoming the world 's largest drug market share group , and the UK 's third largest enterprise .
the new company , called GlaxoSmithKline , has a capital of about 114 billion pounds ( about $ 291.8 billion ) .
shares of the new company fell slightly to 18.31 pounds in early trading yesterday , then gradually rebounded to 18.43 pounds .
the last hurdle to the merger was cleared last week , and the U.S. regulators subsequently agreed to sell some of their products to prevent the merger from being blocked by antitrust .
the shareholders of the European Commission and the company have already nodded to the merger plan earlier .
the new company has a global market share of more than 7 % , with annual turnover higher than any other pharmaceutical manufacturer .
in terms of capital , it is second only to Pfizer , the Viagra manufacturer , in the global pharmaceutical industry , and third in the UK business , after Vodafone and BP .
the merger plan was originally proposed in 1997 , when the two sides fought over who should lead the new company and the merger failed .
in January this year , the two sides proposed a new merger plan , but the implementation of the two delays because of the regulatory authorities have doubts .
to satisfy the U.S. authorities , in August , Americans agreed to sell herpes drugs Famir and Vectavir / Denavir to Norvartis , a Swiss company , for $ 1.63 billion ( about $ 2.8 billion ) and antiemetic Kytril to Tirol , Switzerland , for $ 1.23 billion . he company ( Roche ) .
Xinhua News Agency , Tianjin , December 31 ( Reporter Man Xuejie ) On the last day of the 20th century , the centenarian Zheng Baoju came to his dream-haunted hometown , Dagukou .
at 9 : 00 a.m. , accompanied by his family , Zheng Lao arrived at Dagukou Fort by bus from Tianjin downtown .
one hundred years ago , the smoke of the Eight-Power Allied Army 's forcible landing here had already been exhausted . in the sunshine , more than a dozen soldiers and tourists visited and took pictures in front of the ancient artillery .
according to Zheng , he lived in a fishing village more than 500 meters west of the fort from the Guangxu period to the early liberation .
Rows of adobe houses are often immersed in seawater and people are miserable .
in the distance , apart from renovating the old batteries , fishermen had small buildings and courtyards .
Zhenglao 's adobe house has nowhere to look for .
Zheng Lao asked his little son , Zheng Chun , who was in his 50s , to grab a large amount of saline-alkali soil under his feet and put it in a wooden box that Zheng Lao had already prepared .
suddenly the old man 's eyes were full of tears .
the second leg of Zheng 's return to Dagu is to go to the dockyard in the West about 3 kilometers away from the ancient fort .
it was the place where Zheng Lao had apprenticeship and work in the early Republic of China .
according to Zheng Lao , Dagu dock had a history of 120 years . it was the first shipyard built in northern China by Li Hongzhang when he was engaged in ocean affairs . the main task at that time was to repair the ship for the northern seamen of the Qing government .
before the Sino Japanese War of 1894 , more than 30 warships of Beiyang Navy were repaired here .
but in the Sino Japanese War , most of the Beiyang ships were sunk .
in 1918 , the Dagu dock became the gun factory of the Northern Warlord Cao Kung and was renamed " Dagu Shipyard " .
Zheng is always the earliest apprenticeship in Dagu shipyard .
during the apprenticeship period , no pay , three years later , only 3 yuan a month , wearing a broken uniform , eating vegetable dumplings , the deepest impression is to water the two poplar trees in front of the factory door every day .
after work , we should go to the south side of the workshop to collect firewood and go home to cook wood for cooking .
speaking , the car has arrived at the Dagu dockyard .
the cemetery to the south of the plant has become a complex of oil bases in the Bohai Sea . a new exhibition hall has been built on the west side of the plant , during which more than 100 years of factory history and artifacts have been displayed .
because of the inconvenient action , Zheng Lao could not see clearly and let the car go straight to the old workshop - the dock site .
his young apprentice 's workshop was empty , and the two poplars in front of the workshop had grown into one meter-diameter poplars .
Zheng asked his son to help him down from the car , an empty bottle brought from home to his son , let him 20 meters away from the river to fill the water , himself for the last time this century Poplar water .
according to the manufacturer , there is no longer shipbuilding guns here , not far away from the Xingang Shipyard and Xinhe Shipyard shipbuilding capacity has already exceeded here .
the newly built 10,000-ton dock and modern factory buildings after liberation have made Dagu dock no longer competitive . it will become a historical relic in modern Chinese history and open to visitors .
Zheng Lao 's last stop is the Xingang ship lock .
Zheng always works there from 40s to 60s .
as an old fitter , the ship locks are repaired every day for the past ships .
before liberation , the annual throughput of Tianjin Port was no more than several hundred thousand tons . by the time Zheng retired , the annual throughput of Tianjin Port had reached 10 million tons , while that of Tianjin had reached more than 93 million tons this year .
looking at the spectacular scene of thousands of boats competing on the eastern sea of the lock , listening to the welding sound of the main suspension wall of the 2600-meter long viaduct being repaired over the lock , Zheng Lao held the telescope 's hand trembling , and his mouth kept repeating , " It 's changed , it 's changed , I can 't recognize it . " it 's coming out . "
SBC Communications Inc. is in talks to acquire AT & T Corp.

in the past few weeks , executives of the two companies have met many times to explore the possibility of a merger , according to people familiar with the matter .
southwest Bell may need to spend more than $ 15 billion on this , but no final decision has yet been made , people familiar with the matter said .
southwest Bell and AT & T executives met again Wednesday night by phone and in person .
once the deal is concluded , the decades of AT & T 's independence as Bell 's parent will end .

last year , CingularWireless bought ATT & & & & & Wireless .
Sprint Corp. and Nextel Communications Inc. announced a merger last month , making them the third-largest wireless communications giant in the United States .
southwest Bell has considered several other deals in recent months and held talks with several companies , including MCIInc. last year .
southwest Bell , headquartered in San Antonio , has grown rapidly into the second largest U.S. telecommunications company in the past 20 years .
the company dominates local telephone services in 13 states , including California , Texas and Illinois , serving 36 million families .

the Justice Department has received complaints that blacks and other ethnic minorities were blocked by election officials when they went to multiple locations in Florida to vote .
" we have two representatives in Florida to gather information to see if there is any justification for a federal investigation , " Justice Department spokeswoman Peterman said the day before yesterday .
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , the largest civil rights organization in the United States , said it had received 486 complaints and more than 300 pages of oaths from people blocked from voting .
the Group intends to go to court early this week to accuse the authorities of intimidating voters and violating other voting rights .
the Ministry of justice has the right to bring criminal charges against those who deprive others of their voting rights .

in order to solve the four nuclear issues , the opposition legislators have shown unprecedented unity . in addition to the agreement to close the DPP 's cross-border negotiations , the opposition alliance has even listed the chief executive , Zhang Junxiong , as an unwelcome figure . some of the former DPP legislators have faced unprecedented escort pressure . all I can say is : God bless you .
the first major act of opposition legislators 'boycott was led by Wang Xinping , the president of the Legislative Yuan . Wang Xinping , at the request of the legislators of the three parties and one faction , announced in the evening that he would not attend the seminar of the presidents of the Fifth House of Representatives , and deliberately embarrassed the presidential palace .
" in the course of the cross-court consultation , the majority of the party groups believed that the dignity of legislation should be maintained and suggested that it was not appropriate to attend the forum . "
Wang Xinping also wrote a polite letter to the president explaining why he did not go . the opposition legislators of the three parties and one faction joined hands to cheer on each other , and the common goal in mind was to defect and recall .
" they don 't respect the legislature before they do , and they 're just saying these things to cover up a mistake . "
facing the threat of the opposition legislators , the DPP legislators are very worried and only want God 's blessing .
" we are waiting for miracles to happen , waiting for everyone to turn around and wait . "
with the Kuomintang in control of the population , President Zhang has been listed as an unwelcome target . Tuesday 's general inquiry was immediately cancelled and turned into a counter-censorship . the small agenda change was marked by a major political attempt to join forces to amend the rules for the recall of the president . according to the Kuomintang version , as long as 1 / 4 of the legislators jointly ask the president to defend , after a secret ballot , 2 / 3 of the legislators agree that they can be sent to the Election Committee to vote again , so the amendment of the law to break the first hurdle .
" to complete the above-mentioned statutory procedures , the first is the early amendment to the Enforcement Act of the Legislative Yuan ; the second is the early amendment to the Electoral recall Act of the President and Vice-President ; and the third is the impeachment Act . "
however , the success or failure of the second hurdle depends entirely on the success of the internal integration of the opposition , because the current dominant recall , the pro-democratic party tends to defect and the new party both accept , in the end who pushes for the recall or concentrate on the defection will also be one of the keys to the opposition struggle .

Xinhua News Agency , Sydney , Oct. 20 Share joy with mother .
Xu Hongyan won the women 's discus F12 final by a clear margin on the second day of the Paralympic Games in Sydney .
this is another gold medal for the Paralympic Games after her Atlanta Olympic Games .
she really wanted to say " thank you , mom . "
Xu Hongyan was originally an athlete , and her mother had always placed great hopes on her , hoping that she could go abroad and win glory for her country in international competitions .
but the weather is unpredictable , Xu Hongyan at the age of 18 when an eye disease , so that the world before her eyes is no longer clear .
although her mother once felt sad and frustrated about it , she encouraged Xu Hongyan and supported her to continue on the road of sports when she learned about the disabled sports .
mother told her daughter , although the eyes are no longer bright , but the disabled can also win glory for the country .
according to your character , you can also win in the international arena .
Xu Hongyan is strong and competitive in character and strict in his demands .
in the final , she threw 39 meters for the first time , far ahead of the others .
but there was no smile on her face , and she even shook her head , apparently not very satisfied with her performance .
coach Li Chao said that Xu Hongyan 's first throw was not a good result , she had to exceed 40 meters before it was normal .
Xu Hongyan , 24 , is a teacher at the deaf school in Nantong , Jiangsu .
she won the shot put and the discus runner in the tenth Paralympic Games .
she won three championships in shot put , discus and javelin at the 5th National Paralympic Games , and still holds the world record of 12.12 meters in shot put .
discus is only a subsidiary item of Xu Hongyan , and shot put is her main item .

London , Dec. 19 ( Xinhua News Agency ) - In addition to the occasional tidal waves , the sparsely populated Scottish town of El was silent at midnight .
three northeastern Chinese men huddle around a table in a guest room at the coastal Caloronia Hotel .
wine is a Chinese wine and dishes are Chinese dishes .
it 's hard to believe that they are celebrating the two gold medal .
Yao Bin , one of the three , is now the most famous figure skating coach in China . he is the runner-up of the two World Championships and the champion of the World Grand Prix finals , Shen Xue / Zhao Hongbo .
another is Xu Zhaoxiao , coach of last year 's World Youth Grand Prix finals champion Gao Song .
another is the international referee , Wang Yumin , deputy director of the figure skating Department of the Winter Sports Administration Center of the State Sports Administration of China .
in the final of the World Youth Grand Prix held here on the same day , the two coaches 'disciples won the championship of double skating and men 's single skating respectively , and the Chinese national anthem was sounded twice on the field .
" this is the first time that a Chinese player has won two gold medals in an international competition . let 's celebrate it tonight , " Xu Zhaoxiao said excitedly .
however , they finally chose to return to the room to celebrate in the most affordable way .
although each champion won $ 8,000 in prize money , they were reluctant to part with it .
because of the money , most of the current Figure Skating Coaches in China are looking for gold abroad . the number of domestic coaches , including retired and amateur coaches , is no more than 40 in total , while there are far more Chinese coaches abroad .
as China 's first generation figure skater , Yao Bin won five consecutive national championships . after retirement , he has been fighting for coaching . for more than 10 years , he has brought China 's double skating to the top of the world . many foreign countries have invited him to teach , but this Harbin man has not . Unmoved .
he said : " I will not go abroad to teach , go out is a lot of money , but only at home , I can feel that they are doing a cause , I really love this cause . "
Yao Bin , 44 , had been separated from his wife for more than 10 years , not even a house .
but Yao Bin , director of the Chinese figure skating coaching team , remained stuck on the Chinese ice rink when he became a world-class coach . his greatest wish was to make Shen Xue / Zhao Hongbo win the world championship , let the young athlete Zhang Dan / Zhang Hao grow up as soon as possible and strive for 200 . there was a breakthrough in the 2 Olympic Winter Games .
Xu Zhaoxiao was a member of the Chinese team at the 1980 Lake Placid Winter Olympics .
after 20 years , he has become a famous coach in China , and his pursuit of career is still better than anything else .
" after so many years , I didn 't expect that figure skating in China could take this step .
it 's not easy . "
the most exciting thing in recent years is the moment Chen Lu won the world championship .
Xu Zhaoxiao began to talk , tears almost fell down : " I heard the news at the time the first feeling is : Chinese people can also win the world championship ?
this is figure skating !
after all these years , I finally saw China 's world champion .
speaking of this , Xu Zhaoxiao 's voice was choked with sobs .
however , Yao Bin and Wang Yumin can only sigh at the depression of Chinese women 's single skating after Chen Lu .
although a few coaches have sent a few athletes to the top , China 's figure skating is still in danger . no one has entered the top 20 in women 's single skating for four consecutive years . there are fewer than 500 skaters , compared with 250 thousand in the United States .
" if we all go for money , the 500 people can 't keep it , " Yao said .
there was no celebration in the room , and the air was filled with worries about the future of Chinese figure skating .
at the end of the game , they had no time to see Scotland , and the next day they had to go home and challenge one game after another : the National Championships , the World Youth Championships , the Four Continents , the World Championships .
" I figured out the schedule . today 's Spring Festival is only in Bulgaria , " Yao said .
" it 's like when you were at home for the new year , " Xu Zhaoxiao answered .
a bottle of white wine was drunk at two o 'clock in the morning .
the cold Atlantic wind blowing outside , accompanied by the sound of the Atlantic Ocean waves , makes people feel that it is sincere ice heart and the melody of the ice is beating .

locals know that these are the so-called " florists , " or inns that run the sex business , and even bargain on the roadside during the day , or Onysan , who has just finished his business .
over the years , the business has gone from being a young lady to being an Obasan , serving more people than the older Onesan , but the business is not as good as it used to be . perhaps the inn has survived along the way because of its history or the lax police checks .
" it 's a dead end here . I don 't feel much about it . "
" there will be all these corners , just to see if their government officials have the intention to rectify them . "
there are elementary schools , the highest densely distributed temples in the city , Confucian temples of high moral standing , and small hotels beside the lotus pond , which is a miscellaneous area of cultural , religious and pornographic industries .

according to the Palestinian side , Israeli tanks opened fire on two normal Palestinian civilian vehicles , causing the above casualties .
Israeli forces also prevented Pakistani ambulances from going to the shooting site for treatment and confirming the identity of the deceased .
the Israeli military has confirmed that at least three Palestinians were killed at the site , but said they were killed in an exchange of fire with the Israeli army .

that morning , there were three bomb explosions near the settlement of Gush Kativ in Gaza . five pupils were wounded while playing with a bomb taken to school .

in the late 1970s , after the implementation of reform and opening up , the economy of Guangzhou , Shenzhen and other cities in the Pearl River Delta adjacent to Hong Kong took the lead .
ten years later , the rise of the Yangtze River Delta centered on Shanghai .
in twenty-first Century , where is China 's next economic growth pole ?
... - China 's economic forecast for 2005 - http : / / davyzw.blogchina.com / blog / article _ 106008.579356.html " China is too big for the whole country to develop at the same time , and it 's easy to get into trouble in management , so they 're smart , step by step , one region by one region . "
the Pearl River Delta was built in the 1980s and the Yangtze River Delta in the 1990s . Cai believes that with the foundation laid over the past two decades , China has the strength to create two new economic circles at the same time .
he advised Singaporean investors not to focus on Shanghai and Guangzhou all the time , but on Beijing , Tianjin and Hebei ( that is , Beijing , Tianjin , Hebei ) and southwestern China . "
there is no doubt that the next economic circle will be Beijing , Tianjin and Hebei . "
Cai Guoxiong , 61 , is currently a consultant at Temasek group .
he believes that the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games have provided a " theme " for the rise of Beijing , Tianjin and Hebei . once the Beijing-Tianjin High-speed Railway is completed , it only takes half an hour from Beijing to Tianjin by train , and the integration of the two cities will accelerate abruptly , within the limits of their radiation capacity . the development and integration of Hebei , even northeast China and Shandong will be promoted .
beyond Beijing , Tianjin and Hebei , Cai Guoxiong is also optimistic about some areas in Western China : " the development of the western region has been talked about for five years , has it been a success ?
frankly speaking , development is not fast enough , and the Chinese government is aware of this . "
China Daily quoted Li Zibin , deputy director of China 's Western Development Office , as saying on Monday that the Chinese government will accelerate the development of the western region in the next five years .
it is noteworthy that when a Chinese leader visited Guangxi earlier this month , he urged Guangxi to open wider to the outside world , introduce more foreign capital and management experience , and build itself into an important logistics hub between China and Southeast Asia .
Cai Guoxiong holds that Guangxi occupies a unique position in the development of the western region . first of all , there are 12 provinces and municipalities in Western China , and only Guangxi has seaports , namely Beihai , Fangcheng and Qinzhou . second , Guangxi is not a province in general sense , but an autonomous region . in addition , Nanning , the capital of Guangxi , was selected last year as the host city of the annual Asia-Xi 'an Expo .
Cai Guoxiong pointed out that in order to develop Guangxi into a bridge connecting the western region and Southeast Asia , the primary problem is that the infrastructure can not keep up . Singapore has rich experience in airport management , harbour management , logistics management and so on . " what are we waiting for ? "
he has been to Guangxi more than four or five times in the past seven or eight months , along with Singaporean logistics , real estate , infrastructure and environmental protection companies . "
they are very impressed with the local impression . "
Cai Guoxiong revealed that some of them may announce cooperation projects with local enterprises in the near future .
not only large enterprises , but also small and medium-sized companies can find many opportunities in the development of Guangxi .
one example mentioned by Cai Guoxiong is food processing .
at present , Guangxi has a deep agricultural foundation , but food processing technology can not keep up with , many agricultural products have not yet entered the market will rot : " food processing is not a cutting-edge technology , but if you can introduce this technology , you can open up a large export market . . " "
one of the big difficulties in doing business in China is that it 's hard to get a clear idea of each other 's intentions , but people in the West are more open and will tell you what they want . "
the businessman , who has been rolling in the Chinese market for years , believes that the risks in the western market are actually lower than those in the eastern market : " most importantly , they need you today .
and in the east , they may not need you anymore , but tell you frankly and not export .
or , they want to keep you as a spare tire . "

but so far , the lucky guy hasn 't appeared , and gas stations hope that the winners will contact them quickly to share the joy of winning the prize .
there are more shadows on the market .
the day before yesterday , at the Lamboro market in Indonesia , Aiyub Putih , a fishmonger , was trying to sell fish he had bought from the East Aceh aquatic farm , driving south six hours a few days earlier .
" people are afraid of eating fish now , " he said .
they feel that there are still many corpses in the sea . "
... there is no time to go to grief , " he said .
he had no choice . "
I need money , " he said . "
I need to make ends meet . "
last week 's earthquake and tsunami struck Aceh in Indonesia .
thousands of bodies have not yet been buried , and it is not easy for people to get food and medical supplies for the rest of their lives .
but despite the psychological shadow of the disaster , the urgency of life is forcing Aceh back to work .
therefore , the economy of Banda Aceh , the capital of Aceh , is slowly returning to life .
Indonesia 's largest bank , BankMandir 's branch in Aceh , reopened yesterday .
Shops in the city have also been opened .
roadside stalls are springing up again , selling Indonesian clove leaf cigarettes , peppers and fruit .
this is largely due to the recovery of the supply chain connecting neighboring North Sumatra after the tsunami .
this has alleviated the fuel shortage , caused a steady flow of vehicles carrying other goods on the roads , and caused the once-soaring prices to begin to fall after the disaster .
a few days ago , a 1.5-liter bottle of drinking water in Banda Aceh sold for 8,000 Indonesian guilders ( 85 cents ) and is now selling for 5,000 , although still higher than the 3,000 Indonesian guilders sold before the disaster .

the U.S. Senate voted 85 in favor and 13 against , passing Rice to succeed Powell as Secretary of State .
Rice became the first black Secretary of state in the United States .
the US Senate held a one-day hearing on Rice 's nomination on the 25th and voted on the 26th .
with the ruling Republican Party in the Senate in the majority , Rice 's nomination was fully expected to pass .
but Rice 's policy defense speech at the hearing came under fierce criticism from Democratic senators who accused her of misleading the United States over the past four years as one of the Bush administration 's main policy makers on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction intelligence . the public has exaggerated the progress made by the United States in training Iraqi security forces .
a total of 12 Democratic senators and one independent senator voted against Rice , who became the top Secretary of State in the Senate since the end of World War II .
earlier , the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee approved Rice 's nomination for Secretary of State by 16 votes in favor and 2 votes in opposition on the 19th .
local media and public opinion generally believe that Rice 's succession to Powell as Secretary of State will face many diplomatic difficulties , especially in Iraq , the Middle East peace process , improving the bad image of the United States in Islamic countries because of the war in Iraq , and bridging the gap with allies . such problems are not only the enormous challenges that she must seriously face , but also the thorny problems that she can not avoid .
although some Democrats argued against the mistakes made in the Iraq war , the U.S. Senate voted by 85 votes to 13 on Jan. 26 to pass Rice as Secretary of State .
Les became the first female black Secretary of state in the United States .
the White House said Rice will be sworn in later in the day and will be at the State Department on the 27th .

knowing that his father was about to be privileged by the president , Cai 's son was delighted to hear that he would probably not have to go to jail anymore , but he also had some doubts about the motives of the presidential palace .
Inheriting his father 's identity as a labor activist , he went to the front of the Kuomintang Central Party headquarters today to protest against the theme of the labor hour case .
he believes that President Chen 's pretension to be sent to prison for labor may have a special meaning at this time .
" I think that represents an affirmation of the long-term struggle of the workers 'movement over the past decade , especially of so many workers , including those present today . "
in addition to being impersonated , President Chen also instructed Teho in Su Bingkun 's attempted robbery and homicide , Xi Anshan and Ben Zhaotu 's objection to military service .
and Justice Minister Chen Ki-nan said that as long as the President 's special order comes , he will solve administrative problems as quickly as possible , so that these people can be freed as soon as possible .

regret is a kind of human nature , often before the decision , did not seize the fleeting opportunity , but after the event Zhuge Liang , the result of regret .
because this person always wants to buy regret medicine .
... time flies . 2004 is about to become history .
Inventory of the gains and losses of household investment and financial management over the past year , many people reaped two words : " regret " . "
I regret not buying more houses .
a distant relative of mine saw a multi-storey second-hand house near Dalian Road at the beginning of this year . the unit price was 6000 yuan per square meter . I thought the price was too high to be worth , and even tried hard to dissuade her .
the relative was determined to buy it because he had no room to live .
today , it has risen to more than 7000 yuan per square meter , half a net profit of 100 thousand yuan .
should I follow up and buy one ? " "
I regret why I didn 't throw profits , stop losses and stocks .
it made me sit up and down a few elevators .
if I were prompt and decisive , the money would not shrink . " "
I regret why I didn 't buy more than 14 yuan when I bought a monkey version of the zodiac .
if I eat hundreds of sets , the price is now going up and down . " "
I regret why I bought a new imitation antique .
it is not impossible to pick up a " big leak " occasionally if I practice my eyesight a little bit more poisonously . "
if all four " if " are realized , many people will be able to " grow red " on their books this year . I regret it .
regret is a kind of human nature , often before the decision , did not seize the fleeting opportunity , but after the event Zhuge Liang , the result of regret .
because this person always wants to buy regret medicine .
since regret is human nature , my experience is to face it with a normal heart .
satisfaction is joy , regret is a good remedy for regret ; on the contrary , if you are deeply involved in it , you will bring endless troubles . " if you worry too much , you will become an animal " ( Cevantes , famous Spanish writer ) .
after regret , I look forward to next year , hoping for less regret in 2005 .
Deutsche Bank is competing with rival ING to buy up to 25 % of Bank of Beijing .
the deal could be worth about $ 200 million , giving the foreign groups an important platform in China 's capital .
... The emergence of the first " women 's bank " in Beijing , http : / / davyzw.blogchina.com / blog / article _ 106008.684998.html , two of Europe 's largest banks , are interested in one of China 's medium-sized banks , highlighting the growing importance of China to overseas financial groups .
these financial groups are seeking to benefit from China 's booming economy and growing wealth .
people close to Bank of Beijing say Deutsche Bank has joined the competition in the past two months because of the long-running negotiations between Dutch International Group and Bank of Beijing failed to reach an agreement .
it is learnt that Deutsche Bank is conducting a due diligence investigation of the state-owned bank of Beijing .
of the 112 city banks in China , Beijing bank is the sixteenth largest bank .
by the end of last year , the assets of the Bank of Beijing amounted to 209 billion yuan ( $ 25 billion ) and deposits to 189 billion yuan .
the bank 's bad loans accounted for 4.8 % of the total loans last year , lower than the industry average .
however , it is understood that Holland International Group is still negotiating with the Bank of Beijing .
Bank of Beijing is expected to finalize an equity deal with one of the two companies in the next two months .
the sale of Beijing 's shares could trigger another wave of overseas investment in China 's small city banks , which have fewer financial and management problems than the Big Four state-owned banks .
China Construction Bank and Bank of China , one of the four big state-owned banks , are seeking foreign partners , followed by a planned multi-billion dollar public listing .
but concerns about the size of such investments and the bad debts of the two banks hampered buyers .
analysts say foreign bidders will have to pay about $ 200 million to acquire up to 25 % of Bank of Beijing .
the 25 % is the upper limit permitted by the Bank of Beijing .
the Bank of Beijing is considering listing in China this year .
the bank has more than 90 branches in Beijing and may use recent rules to expand beyond Beijing .
analysts say what attracts foreign groups is the bank 's expansion plans , as well as the opportunity to issue credit cards and establish asset management joint ventures .
all three banks declined to comment yesterday , but people familiar with the deal said the price had not yet been negotiated and negotiations could still break down .

it continues to be political news from the United States .
the U.S. presidential election is in its final two weeks of battle , and the main bipartisan candidates are struggling for traditional support .
at the same time , it is trying to attract free votes .
the following is a report from Shu Guofu , VOA special correspondent , from Losangeles .
the presidential election entered a decisive stage .
Republican Governor George W. Bush and Democratic Vice President Al Gore are trying to attract indecisive voters in addition to continuing to consolidate their traditional votes .
in Kansas City , Bush told 28 Republicans and governors from across the country that he had achieved a lot during his tenure as governor of Texas , while Vice President Gore created real obstacles to every reform .
the governors will organize a group to visit Bush in 48 cities in 25 states in three days .
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ritchie said : " Bush is launching governors everywhere because the last minute of the election will be critical to the voter turnout in the fierce states . "
in addition to urging African-American voters and trade unions to step up their support for him , Vice-President Gore began to devote every morning to face-to-face conversations with ordinary people about their concerns .
he met with representatives of 200 utility employees from the International Union of Trade Unions in Washington last Saturday , and Gore attacked Bush 's remarks that he planned to withdraw U.S. peacekeeping troops from the Balkans .
he also asked union leaders to mobilize all 1 million 400 thousand members to vote .
the conference was broadcast live to 17 venues in the United States by satellite .
the International Union of public utility employees is the largest union of the Federation of labor unions .
in Michigan , Pennsylvania , Missouri , Wisconsin and Ohio , the elections are complex .
the National Rifle Association , which supports Bush , and the Federation of Labor Associations , which supports Gore , are the most politically influential organizations in these states .
members of the National Rifle Association , however , disagreed with the group 's ideas , with 40 percent of the members in Pennsylvania , Missouri , Michigan and the Federation of Labor and Associated Production agreeing with the NRA 's position .
the leaders of the Federation of trade unions ( CIA ) threatened to grasp every vote of the members .
the leader of the Rifle Association threatened to win the vote of every blue-collar worker who loved freedom .
Gore 's tighter gun control legislation , despite the support of a majority of voters , has also led many voters to believe that the NRA and Bush say it is more important to enforce existing laws than to pass new ones .
the results of the poll showed that Gore did not get more support for the way guns were controlled .
Gore has been meeting with ordinary voters every morning since Monday to talk about their immediate problems at home or at work .
Bush and Gore are now very close to each other in the polls , with Bush slightly ahead of Gore in several national surveys , which could be the most vocal presidential election in 40 years between the two main candidates .
each week could play a key role in securing 270 electoral votes to win the White House .
these are reports from Shu Guofu , VOA special correspondent , from Losangeles .

Russia 's president yesterday lashed out at Russia 's problematic privatisation in the early 1990s , arguing that the state had every right to nationalize Yukos 'core assets in order to compensate for these problems .
relevant topic : Russia will " split " Yukos assets * At a three-hour press conference in the Kremlin , Vladimir Putin said : " you are very clear , Russia in the early 1990s , how the privatization process is going on . Yes , many market participants have acquired billions of dollars worth of state property through various tricks , sometimes even illegal means . " "
today , the Russian government is using absolutely legitimate market mechanisms to safeguard national interests , which I think is quite normal . "
earlier , Putin stressed that Yukos was caught by the government because of tax evasion .
but yesterday 's argument provides a new reason for the Yukos affair , which could also apply to other companies created during the privatisation process in the 1990s .
late Wednesday night , the state-owned Russian state oil company Rosneft took over Yugankneftegas , Yukos 's main production unit .
Yugan 's oil production accounts for 11 % of Russia 's total output .
Rosneft is the managing director of the Putin administration .
Rosneft has bought only 9 billion 350 million dollars , which is far below the market value of the latter .
Rosneft is merging with Gazprom to create a giant state-owned company .
Mr. Putin , who has sharp words , also mocked the previous judgment of the Houston court .
after Yukos filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States , the court last week issued a ban on the sale of any assets of Yukos .
Mr Putin said the U.S. judge who made the decision " may not even know where Russia is , " questioning the competence of Texas courts .
he said the ruling was an example of the U.S. attempt to dominate the world , demonstrating its typical practice of double standards against Russia .

Wang Wenyang expressed disdain for the anonymous black letter .
the black letter sent to the media , without a name , could not see where the fax came from .
the content emphasizes that Wang Wenyang was a secret envoy on both sides of the Strait , cheating the mainland political cash , and was found by his father Wang Yongqing .
Wang Wenyang , worried about the East Window incident , simply deepened the office theft into a family struggle in order to blur the focus .
for Wang Wenyang , he said he did not want to dance with inexplicable accusations .
" don 't just ignore it .
we are all busy , we have no time , and you are busy .
I suggest that in the future these things , if they are not named , they should not be dealt with .
Wang Wenyang said that he did not know who wrote the black letter , and the Red Man Group also believed that the black letter was basically a combination of all the recent incidents against Wang Wenyang , too rich in imagination .
I hope the media can stop this and not be taken advantage of .

a survey by the Financial Services Agency of Japan ( FSA ) has found that one in 10 listed Japanese companies cheat investors in their financial statements , undermining the credibility of the Japanese stock market and weakening Japan 's reputation as an international financial centre .
... A survey by the Financial Services Agency of Japan ( FSA ) has found that one in 10 listed Japanese companies cheat investors in their financial statements , undermining the credibility of the Japanese stock market and weakening Japan 's reputation as an international financial centre .
the Financial Services Department gave all 4547 listed companies a month to review their financial statements and report irregularities .
it is said that 456 companies have admitted publishing misleading reports , most of which are related to the size of large shareholders 'holdings . "
" mistakes in financial statements , whether they are deliberate , unintentional or minor , are detrimental to the credibility of our financial markets and need to be thoroughly addressed , " said Hirofumi Gomi , Commissioner of the Financial Services Department .
before the investigation was launched , Seibu Railway admitted that it had provided false information about its largest shareholder for more than 40 years to cover up its violations of ownership rules .
since the scandal , the company has lost more than 70 % of its market value and was disqualified last week by the prestigious Eastern Securities One .
in response to the crisis , the FSA is considering new corporate governance rules modelled on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of the United States .
the new rules will force listed companies to specify how they prevent violations .
the new rules may give Japan one of the strictest compliance systems in industrialized countries .
however , because the new regulations will increase the operating costs of enterprises , it may be resisted by the company .
Japan 's Finance Agency has suggested that executives should be forced to write down internal management controls , which could force many companies to update or implement compliance rules for the first time in years .
the original version of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was used by officials of the Financial Services Department in planning .
this section has been resisted by U.S. companies , which say it is too costly and too intrusive .
Japan 's Finance Agency also said that the audit department should verify the management 's assessment , enterprises violating the disclosure requirements should be fined .
the proposal is being discussed by the Financial Services Committee , the department 's most influential decision-making body .
the Tokyo Stock Exchange took another step , mimicking the U.S. response to accounting scandals at Enron and other companies .
last week , Tokyo said it would soon require executives , not just auditors , to guarantee the contents of its financial statements .

officials say China must properly handle the relationship between local , urban and rural development and population distribution , in line with environmental protection and economic growth .
after completion , the highway will help Taiwan , Hong Kong and the mainland of China to upgrade their competitiveness and living environment . it will connect all provinces , large and medium-sized cities with a network of more than one billion people .
in the process of expressway construction , better use of land resources can prevent environmental damage .
the planned expressway network will stretch to Hong Kong and Macao , and include bridges in Zhuhai and Macao .

the position here is pretty good , in our business , business , the life of the elderly are very good .
on the part of our government authorities , as for the small Chinese communities , we also need radio stations that are mainly in Chinese and mother tongue , so in this respect , the government is also taking less care of our Chinese people .
although it is said that our broadcast time will not be very long , our daily broadcast , Chinese broadcast time is only 5 hours .
our programs , our content , such as a lot of information , some community activities , there are some dynamic , social dynamics , we can all know from our radio programs .

in fact , Brunei and Malaysia are similar to a lot of places , on the one hand , speaking the language , Malaysia 's official language is mainly Malay , and then the way of life is also very similar .
countries that live in tropical climates have similar lifestyles .
that is to say , Malaysia , Singapore , Brunei , we Borneo people 's way of life is no different .
when it comes to history , Brunei was called the Kingdom of Sudan in the fifteenth century , and by the middle of the sixteenth century , Portugal , Spain , the Netherlands and Britain invaded it one after another .
Brunei became a British protectorate in 1888 .
in 1959 , Britain signed an agreement stipulating that defence , security and foreign affairs should be handled by Britain .

previously , there was a debate in Japanese society about whether the constitution should be amended to allow women to inherit the throne .
Japan will now consider allowing the royal family to adopt a male , the Nikkei Shimbun reported Wednesday .

IBM , the US commercial machine company , recently reported that IBM 's personal computer unit , which was recently sold to Lenovo Group , a Chinese computer company , had been at a loss for more than three years .
analysts said the news could be a blow to ambitious Lenovo 's attempts to elevate its international status .
... IBM disclosed in its quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday that its PC division lost $ 140 million in the first two quarters of January-June 2004 .
this loss has lasted for three and a half years .
the PC sector lost $ 258 million in 2003 , $ 171 million in 2002 and nearly $ 400 million in 2001 .
the Bloomberg News Agency , a U.S. financial news agency , reported that IBM had rarely disclosed the profitability of its PC division in the past .

the hardware servo operated by the hardware group is in good condition .
IBM sold its PC division to China 's Lenovo Computer Group for $ 1.25 billion in early December 2004 in an effort to reduce losses and improve the group 's book image .
industry insiders in Lenovo and IBM in the acquisition deal , said that although the merger will greatly expand the size of Lenovo , Lenovo in the international arena to occupy a place as a world-class company , but the company will also face many management challenges , profits . it may be diluted .
IBM 's earnings report confirms the earnings pressures that the merger could put on Lenovo .
analysts believe Lenovo 's leadership must have understood the impact of IBM 's PC business before the acquisition was completed , but the extent of the loss in this part of the business may have been unexpected .
Lenovo is a native Chinese company , and it is very difficult to integrate American companies with completely different cultures and operating environments into an organic whole .
Tokyo 's Toshiba president , Okamura , said he did not see any benefit to Lenovo from acquiring IBM 's personal computer business .
Duane Titner , HP 's executive vice president , believes that a Chinese company suddenly manufactures products for the U.S. or French markets will face highly complex logistics and supply chain problems .
analysts pointed out that less than a month after the merger , IBM reported a three-and-a-half-year loss in its personal computer business , surprising everyone who cared about Lenovo .
it seems that the integration of new companies is not smooth .

China 's top officials publicly pointed out yesterday that Chen Jiulin , president of China Aviation Oil ( Singapore ) , did not know much about futures and was a " third-rate " futures speculator .
the SASAC announced on its website that it will conduct special inspections of state-owned enterprise acquisitions at the central level , including inspecting whether state-owned enterprise acquisitions abroad have been reported to SASAC for approval by other government departments .
... At the annual meeting sponsored by Caijing magazine , Li Jiange , deputy director of the Development Research Center of the State Council of China , highlighted the difficulty of the Chinese government 's supervision of overseas activities of state-owned enterprises . "
not long ago , there was a problem with CNOOC 's Chen Jiulin . I read in the newspapers that when the matter was exposed and dealt with by the judiciary , he also said that if the government gave me more money , I would be through the crisis in two weeks . "
the deputy minister said bluntly : " I do not know whether he ( Chen Jiulin ) is self-defense or really do not understand ? "
on November 30 last year , China Aviation Oil ( Singapore ) announced to the market that it had lost $ 550 million by selling short oil futures , technically bankrupt .
after the incident , oil futures prices began to fall .
Chen Jiulin , who had been investigated at that time , told the media that before " as long as there is a sum of money , we can survive and turn over " .
Li Jiangge , who once supervised futures in China , said that China 's aviation oil rivals in the futures market would only stop raising prices after they had forced him to burst their positions . if Chen Jiulin were given another two weeks , the price of oil futures would only continue to rise , No . may fall . "
if he is defending himself , it can be understood .
if he really doesn 't understand , people like him go to the world to speculate in futures ( it 's inevitable to lose money ) ... He may also be a third-rate speculator in the domestic futures market . "
Li Jiange said .
after the exposure of the CNOOC incident , Chen Jiulin expressed his sorry to investors many times , but only admitted that his mistake was " too trusting others " .
in a special report at the end of last year , China 's highly acclaimed Caijing pointed out that Chen Jiulin had no knowledge of the risks of futures trading , the growing losses but did not know to cut positions , believed that his market judgment was correct , and insisted on accounting losses . it is not a real loss .
Li Jiangge , a high-risk state-owned enterprise going out , said that China 's domestic capital is relatively abundant , so enterprises have a high enthusiasm for " going out " to invest overseas .
he thinks there is a big risk in it : " is our country in particular capable of protecting its property rights overseas ? "
the SASAC announced on its website that it will conduct special inspections of state-owned enterprise acquisitions at the central level , including inspecting whether state-owned enterprise acquisitions abroad have been reported to SASAC for approval by other government departments .

huge losses occur from time to time even though the Chinese government set up the SASAC in 2003 to regulate state-owned assets in a unified manner , the illegal operations of state-owned enterprise managers eventually result in huge losses still occur from time to time .
last year , China National Cotton Reserve Management Corporation ( CNRC ) was locked up 1 billion yuan ( RMB ) for pursuing windfall profits and making mistakes in cotton import decisions , in addition to the huge losses caused by China Aviation Oil listed in Singapore in violation of the government 's " no speculative trading " regulations .

the loss of state-owned assets caused by the two may exceed 50 million yuan , together with the leakage of corporate and personal income tax , the total may exceed 80 million yuan .

because of this , the rate of case detection is too low .
the pre-festival public security situation in Nanjing is not optimistic . Wen / Wu-lao 's sister 's house has just been decorated . Brothers and sisters are invited to take their children with them to visit . it is also a year ago to get together and have a good time . it is scheduled for Sunday noon .
the younger sister 's family lives in the Drum Tower District in Nanjing , where the public security situation is better . it is only the first floor of the old house and is easy to be stolen .
there is a small courtyard on the first floor , about 5 meters out of the sun platform is a small slope , the slope is the police room of the public security , from the police room to see my sister 's home , clear .
but that 's the problem .
we went out for dinner at about 12 : 20 , and came back around 14 : 30 . we opened the door and found nothing . we found something wrong in the bedroom , the cupboard door was open , and we went in and looked at the mess .
at this time , it was found that the burglar railings of the balcony were pulled open .
the first thing to do is to protect the scene .
we pulled out and called 110 . it didn 't work . it still didn 't work . there seemed to be too many people calling the police .
several phone calls at the same time dial 110 , and finally passed .
after waiting for about 15 minutes , the police station arrived .
it 's no use . we 'll have to wait for the Interpol 's police .
the police at the police station made at least five calls to the Criminal Police Force at our urging , presumably busy or not .
police stations said that it does not seem like a crime committed by fleeing criminals , or easy to investigate , if fleeing criminals , to get a handful of home on New Year 's Day , the hope is not great .
my sister cried , and her nephew , who had just returned from the field , accompanied his mother and comforted her .
my sister-in-law and I accompanied the police at the police station . a member of the United Defense Force waited outside for the arrival of the police car of the Criminal Police Force .
the police station 's phone rang , saying that the police did not know my sister 's home , can not find a place , I had to wait outside .
after a while , a red Otto police car with a Su 0-A x x x x x drove in , and only one person got off with a toolbox .
I looked at my watch . it was 15 : 20 .
the police of the Interpol were busy on-the-spot exploring for an hour or so , and then told us that we could count what was missing , and then he left .
the three sisters counted , but fortunately , the loss of cash is not much , because they all use cards , only hundreds of dollars , mainly some gold and silver jewelry and digital supplies , the value is not bad .
the police of the local police station made a transcript and then went away .
on leaving , he said , it seemed hopeful that the case could be solved , for it was reflected that some young men , sitting on the railings at the entrance of the police office at noon , stared at their sister 's yard , presumably them .
it 's almost six .
after comforting our sister , we went home .
on the second day , I called my sister in law to ask the situation .
Son-in-law said that there was no news , but to the public security bureau made a complaint , the Public Security Bureau has just sent a police inspector to investigate the police out of time .
as for whether we can solve the case , I am afraid I can not count on it .
think back to N years ago , my home has been stolen once , the Interpol is too late , after exploration is no news , I am afraid , almost 10 years .
about two years ago , there was a high incidence of burglaries , and many thieves wanted to get a handful home for the New Year , although the case in the sister 's house was probably not a case of fleeing criminals .

BaFin declined to discuss the details of the investigation , such as how many people were involved in the case , or whether the case involved other companies .
BaFin said the agency began investigating a deal with Citigroup in October to find out if it was suspected of manipulating the market in futures trading on the European Futures Exchange .
in August , Citigroup issued a 11 billion selling order to the bond market , including the EuroMTS bond trading platform .
as a result , European bond prices fell sharply , prompting traders to trade quickly on the European Futures Exchange to reduce losses and thus exacerbate the decline in European bonds .

Citigroup will continue to fully cooperate with all relevant bodies to review the incident .
a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in Frankfurt declined to comment .

Yao Jizhi , a Chinese-American computer professor , was the first Chinese to win the Turing Award , the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in computer science . the Nobel Wizard was originally born in physics .
he has enjoyed science since middle school , and he regarded physicist Yang Zhenning as an idol when he was in college . he naturally got a PhD in physics .
Influenced by his beloved wife , Chu Feng , Yao decided to give up physics research and " go home halfway " and " start from scratch " to read computer science . a relationship between husband and wife , due to the fate of the meeting , created this wonderful computer world .
Yao Jizhi was invited by the Chinese University to be Professor of Bowen this year . he is the Fourth International Professor of Bowen in CUHK after physicist Yang Zhenning , mathematician Qiu Chengtong and economist James A. Mirrlees .
Yao Jizhi , who was born in Shanghai as an idol , studied in Hong Kong as a freshman and went to Taiwan in the 1950s .
he recalled that many of his classmates wanted to be scientists in high school , when everyone worshipped Einstein .
I remember reading " Theory of Relativity " in high school , which opened his eyes . " I felt a joy that I could not get from anything else . I learned the joy of reading . "
later , Yang Zhenning won the Nobel Prize in Physics and became Yao 's idol . he also decided to study physics in university .
in college physics reading , Yao Zhi Zhi described " more interesting than reading novels . "
but after a few hard years with a Ph.D. in physics , he did only one year 's research . at the age of 26 , he switched to computer science , leaving home half-way because of his beloved wife .
my wife , who was also a math doctor at MIT , was working for a professor of computer theory when she became addicted to computers .
" both husband and wife do scientific research , so they have a chance to talk to each other , so it 's natural to come into contact with [ computer science ] . "

( Tallahassee , France ) The Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore 's presidential dream suffered two days after a Florida judge rejected a lawsuit filed by the Democratic camp over the Florida ballot dispute the day before yesterday and the Federal Supreme Court questioned the decision to allow overdue recounts of votes . a fatal blow .
however , Gore continued to appeal to the Florida Supreme Court after a Florida circuit court dismissed all his lawsuits against the Florida presidential election .
Gore 's chief attorney , James Boyce , said the Circuit Court 's ruling should be the final showdown , although two cases were scheduled to be heard Wednesday local time in Tallahassee , Florida .
he said , " they won , and we lost .
we are appealing .
the appeal will be decided by the Florida Supreme Court , which I believe will end the presidential campaign .
he said , " no matter who wins , we will accept it . "
George W. Bush 's lawyers cheered after Lyon County Circuit Court Justice J. Salls dismissed all the Gore Camp lawsuits over the counting results .
" this is a major decision made by the court , " Ginsberg , senior counsel to George W. Bush , told AFP .
in explaining his verdict , Mr. Sols said Gore 's camp did not give reasons for recounting some counties in Florida , nor did it prove that there was anything wrong with the result .
Sauers said : " the court held that the evidence provided by the plaintiff was insufficient . "
Boyce , however , claims that Sols did not take into account the most critical evidence , and that he did not examine what the Gore camp said was a miscalculated ballot and a ballot that had not been counted at all .
Gore believes that if more than 12,000 disputed votes were recalculated artificially in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties , he could overthrow George W. Bush 's weak advantage in Florida and win the presidential race .
however , the judge said it was unfair to voters in other counties who did not recalculate their votes .
Sols announced his ruling hours after the Federal Supreme Court asked the Florida Supreme Court to reconsider its decision to allow overdue recounts of disputed ballots .
the Supreme Court said it did not understand why Florida judges made such a decision .
the George W. Bush camp refers to the Supreme Court of Florida .
Florida Supreme Court spokesman Walters said the court asked the two sides to submit a new argument Tuesday local time .
he did not rule out the possibility of hearing the case together with the appeal for Sauers 's ruling .
if Florida judges overturn their earlier decision , it means Gore 's lawyers have missed a 10-day buffer period to challenge the election results , meaning their appeals are meaningless .
on Wednesday , Florida judges will hear two separate Democratic appeals .
they demanded that 25,000 votes , mostly for George W. Bush , be nullified because the electors were biased toward the Republicans in dealing with them .
once the plaintiff wins any of these cases , Gore will win the Florida campaign and then enter the White House , and Bush will certainly appeal against the ruling .

you tell me , from today on , your life center will no longer be home , but a school .
I tell you : casual .
half a month is 1st anniversary .
strictly speaking , it is registration 1st anniversary .
what kind of marriage is this ?
I thought this blog was a place for me to lament happiness , and I didn 't expect it to be a place to complain to myself .
Brad was separated and Hitomi Kuroki was fast .
I think we are almost the same .
I wish you happy .
everything will live according to your wishes , and I hope you will not feel wronged again .
between two people , alas .
just a big mouth .
some words , not to say or not to say , leave some room for the speaker to speak out in anger , listeners often bear in mind , even after reconciliation , several times down , was born with these injuries .
be tolerant of each other and say anything .
I almost got married before I fell in love .
everyone is different . my brother-in-law also says that one country can have two systems .
Metaphor is not so appropriate , but it contains some spirit of inclusiveness .
sometimes I want to be a liberman , single for a while , or find someone else later . it seems that many great people have been married many times . ha ha .
but it 's not easy to be single . anything else is not necessarily good .
well , it 's better to think about improving yourself first . try it . thank you !
I think it 's because we all started living independently very early , so we 're all a bit conceited and unwilling to bow to each other easily .
last night , two people slept separately .
about 2 , as if she was not asleep .
I stretched out my hand and pulled her hand . I really didn 't want to be so stubborn .
later we apologized to each other .
think about nothing .
...
maybe I 'm not mature enough , maybe .
I will improve . thank you for pointing out .
this is a good man !
sometimes a woman 's quarrel is so bitter that she breaks her heart and tears come down , not just for a word , but for a man , he refuses to say it .
alas .
well , now that you take the initiative , your wife will be very happy .
I really don 't know before I get married . women have a strong sense of vanity and nothing happens after one or two rhetoric . a girlfriend told me to coax my wife .
what they want is face , ha ha .
good evening , listeners . I am Haiyan .

Xinhua News Agency , Lisbon , November 17 ( Reporter Xie Peng ) Portuguese local media confirmed today that the European sports tribunal has decided to reduce the European Football Association 's ban on Portuguese player Saville from nine months to seven months .
Uefa has decided to ban Saville from international competition for nine months starting July 2 after he offended the referee in Portugal 's semi-final against France in this summer 's European Championships .
since then , Shaville has been dissatisfied with the appeals , and ultimately achieved this " commutation " of two months .
the ruling means the player who is now playing for England 's Everton team can return to international football after January .
Shaville expressed his satisfaction with this , calling it a " persistent victory , " but he also said that the seven-month ban is unfair .
Anhui Province recently passed a regulation banning the use of ultrasound scanning technology to test the sex of the fetus and stipulating that ultrasound scanning is only used for medical purposes .
a survey by relevant government departments found that the ratio of male to female newborn babies in Anhui Province was imbalanced in the past six years .
part of the reason for this is that many parents decide to terminate their pregnancy when they discover that the fetus is a woman , Xinhua said .
according to the new regulations issued by Anhui Province , induced abortion is only carried out within 16 weeks of pregnancy and when the health of pregnant women is threatened .
according to the regulations , offenders will be expelled from public service and fined , analysts pointed out that because more and more non-public officials , the implementation of the regulations will encounter difficulties .
it is understood that China 's current ratio of men and women is 131 to 100 , according to international standards , this ratio is abnormal , the above report is a group of Chinese newsletters .
I was born and raised in Nanjing , except for ten years of serving in Shanghai , although my parents only came to Nanjing with the army south .
I am a native of Nanjing . although my father only came to Nanjing with the army south , I was born and raised in Nanjing , except for ten years in Shanghai .
in my childhood , apart from the good greening of the main roads , the wide roads , and the appearance of several large organs and colleges , Nanjing was basically a slum , especially in the Xiaguan District in the north , the industrial district in the South and the Qinhuai District in the south . after the reform and opening up .
it can be said that in the past twenty years , Nanjing has changed every day , the better .
as a common people living in this city , I am also very happy .
in addition , Nanjing was the ancient capital of the Nine Dynasties ( the Ten Dynasties ) , so far many places of interest in Nanjing , but also used by our descendants to visit , and become the pride of Nanjing people .
there is also the Zijin Mountain in Nanjing , Xuanwu Lake , Mochou Lake and so on , are famous scenic spots in the country , every year tourists from all over the country come to visit .
perhaps the most distinctive feature of Nanjing is its profound cultural heritage , which has been ahead of the nation 's scientific and technological forces since the early liberation . numerous colleges , universities and research institutes , with a large number of personnel , are unique in the country .
it is said that academicians in Nanjing , apart from Beijing , counted Nanjing , ranking second in the country .
then there is the lovely Nanjing people who laugh at themselves as big radishes . the simple , honest , tolerant and comfortable atmosphere is incomparable to many cities .
although the spoken language of the Nanjing people is too rude to be heard , it seems nothing compared with the many advantages of the Nanjing people .
having lived in Nanjing for decades , I feel deeply for my hometown . Similarly , like all Nanjing people , I owe a little to Nanjing .
but loving Nanjing does not mean that we can not criticize Nanjing 's individual government organs , nor does it mean that we can not criticize some ugly phenomena in Nanjing .
of course , this criticism is well-intentioned , has positive significance , is to hope that Nanjing is better .
this may be a ridiculous question , but after so many years in the United States , it turns out that some Americans are not really clear .
first of all , sports , NBA championship by the U.S. media and fans called WORLD CHAMPION , college and professional baseball league championship battle known as WORLD SERIES , and so on .
it is undeniable that the high level of American sports , can be invincible in the United States , did not play with other countries before , can self-proclaimed world champion ?
it 's no news that American baseball , ice hockey , basketball , and Dream N teams have lost to other countries in the Olympics and other continental arenas , but they can still be the world champions with their thick skin and modesty .
politically , the president and vice president of the United States are known as the number one , number two and the most POWER person in the world .
is it really NB that holds the button of a nuclear weapon ?
there 's plenty of that button , old Russia , old China , North Korea , enough for your president to drink a couple of pots .
tell me some real funny things .
I used to work in a city in the north where there was a shoe market and the word white and black was the largest in the world .
I don 't know if the shopkeeper has actually gone to other countries to compare , or if someone has made a study of the conclusions , or simply feel special NB , so self-styled , also wrote in the local guide .
I 've been to that market . it 's big . but the shoe market I 've seen in China is several times bigger than that guy 's . it 's probably not the biggest market in China , even in the north of China .
then I went to another place to work , and coincidentally , a nearby town called itself " CHICKEN CAPITAL OF THEWORLD " , the capital of the world 's chickens !
what a cow !
it 's not that there are so many prostitutes in that place , but that place is rich in fried chicken . the local people love chicken very much and they love making chicken very much .
according to statistics , consumption of N tons of chicken per year .
I looked at that number , and then looked up the number of some cities in China , let me laugh bitterly .
Chinese people are so fond of making chickens and consuming chickens , nor have they sealed the world .
I am puzzled by the American knowledge of the size of the world .
so she asked an American colleague , she heard my question , feel very fresh , never thought that before , think the world is so big , 50 states so big .
she thought about it , and finally blamed the isolation of the United States , Canada above , Mexico below , no other neighbors , unlike Europe .
there is some truth to this statement , but in China , except for border provinces , other places have no international borders , but have never seen such NB baking .
after World War II , many Americans feel that the United States represents the world , whether you agree or not , whether verified or not , Lao Tzu is a cow , you live in our world , you must recognize us as the boss .
with China , India , the European Community strong , more and more American factory farms closed , transfer to Asia , so-called high-tech transfer will happen sooner or later , one day , the Americans woke up , suddenly found : the original world is much larger than the United States .

the incident , which took place on Oct. 31 and killed 82 people , led to the prosecution of three pilots of Singapore Airlines by " business negligence death " in Taoyuan District Court .
Liu Weiqi , chairman of the Flight Safety Committee of the Executive Yuan , said today that there is no such practice in the international community , and the local procuratorate had better make more considerations .
the Flying Safety Commission will also collect international data on the handling of Flying Safety and provide further reference for the prosecution .
Ceng Guohua continues to report .
Singapore Airlines , which has always been a model student in aviation flight safety records , has been confirmed to have killed 82 people when it took off at Taoyuan Zhongzheng International Airport after the pilot accidentally broke into a runway and crashed into a guardrail , causing the fuselage to explode and catch fire .
as the cause of the accident was directed to human factors , the Taoyuan Land Procuratorate also actively intervened in handling the case , not excluding the prosecution of three pilots for " business negligence death " .
however , the flight safety committee has a reserved attitude towards the prosecution 's movements .
in attending the Legislative Yuan Transport Committee , chairman of the Flight Safety Committee , Liu Weiqi No. 6 , said that the prosecution did not understand the full responsibility of the Flight Safety Committee and the investigation of aircraft crashes , so after the accident , the domestic investigation mode is better than the foreign investigation mode .
if the prosecution takes the initiative to intervene in the investigation and prosecute the pilots , although this is in line with domestic law , it will create international practice , so it is better to be cautious .
" I suggest that we should be more cautious and prudent in this regard , because there is no such practice in the international arena , " Liu said .
so even if we are to do things according to the pure laws of our country , we have to think about it .
Liu said that they will collect some international practices to deal with the security incidents for the prosecution to provide further reference , otherwise it will probably attract international public criticism , Taiwan as a refusal to contact the country .
Ceng Guohua , reporter of Taipei international voice , reports from Taipei .

a couple named Lu and their 17-year-old daughter , a family of three in Alian Township , Kaohsiung County , committed suicide by drinking herbicide late last night .
the family members found that they rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment and finally recovered their lives .
but their digestive organs were badly burned , and the family members who committed suicide said they might owe a lot of money because of the horns .
when the three of Liao Quanxian 's family were sent to Rongzhong 's emergency room , they were filled with the stinking smell of pesticides . the doctors immediately performed emergency gastric lavage and enema , diluting the poisons in the esophagus and stomach . the situation was very urgent .
and family members anxiously waiting outside the hospital , after the doctor 's efforts , the three people are finally stable .
her husband , Liao Quanxian , was still in pain , and her 17-year-old daughter could not speak , but simply nodded and shook her head .
" do you want to drink that medicine or do your parents want you to drink it ?
you drank it yourself .
the uncle who came to take care of it did not bear to bear it .
just because the Liao family was almost driven mad by money , Liao Quanxian 's mother , who lives opposite , said last night that nearly 10 creditors had come to her house . by the time she found out , three people had drunk medicine and poured it on the bed .
doctors say the three men drank an acidic herbicide , no antidote , and only maintained treatment , but the condition has stabilized .
the Dutch medical team on June 26 overturned the association of " economy class syndrome " in which prolonged confinement in a narrow space could lead to thrombosis leading to sudden death .
they argue that there is insufficient evidence that the economy class syndrome has its own problems , and that the possibility is overblown .
a healthy British woman was hospitalized after a 20-hour flight into the lobby when she collapsed and died , according to a 27-day report .
the doctor pointed out that the death was due to a thrombus that had flowed into the heart and caused sudden death , the so-called " economy class syndrome " .
health advocates say thousands of passengers die each year from deep venous embolism .
the main cause of this fatal disease is prolonged inactivity , or crowded seats that block blood flow to the legs , increasing the risk of thrombosis .
but this is a rare phenomenon , because fatality may occur after a month of flight , when the thrombus reaches the lungs and heart .
but the team at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands points out that there is no evidence to support this claim .
in the forthcoming issue of the Journal Four Needles , which is due to be published on August 28 , they pointed out that previous experiments did not properly use the control group , that is , there were no subjects of any medical problem , and therefore no fair comparison of any risk was possible .
there will be new developments in personnel changes in the Indonesian military . Tyaano Sudarto , the outgoing chief of staff of the Indonesian army , will not dismount , but will rise to a higher level and be promoted to the commander-in-chief of the three armies to replace the current Victor Dodo .
the move also included the abolition of the post of Chief of Staff of the Regional Counseling Office of the Armed Forces , which has traditionally governed grass-roots military organizations throughout Indonesia , including political participation . the incumbent is Agos Vezzozo .
Jakarta 's presidential palace revealed that President Wahid would announce a new appointment on October 18 ; he announced the day before yesterday ( Monday ) that he was replacing the Army Chief of Staff and the Navy Chief of Staff , who were their deputies , but did not say where his predecessor had gone .
the Indonesian Army has always been powerful , and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army has traditionally been promoted by the Army Chief of Staff ; Wahid changed that tradition two years ago to elevate Navy Chief of Staff Victor Dodo , when his deputy left the Army Chief of Staff , but the post was abolished last month . .
the deployment has sparked speculation that the Indonesian military has been involved in a series of bombings in Jakarta over the past two months , and that police have been under pressure to arrest about 30 suspects , including two soldiers , on suspicion of September . the 3 Day bombing on the Jakarta stock exchange .
sources revealed that the exchange bombing was the most sensational , in addition to dozens of deaths and injuries , the suspect 's background is also complex , military intelligence shows that high-ranking officers and foreign forces are involved .
according to the analysis , Indonesia 's military mobilization is part of the overall restructuring of the three armed forces , but the military conservatives and reformers also take this opportunity to fight for power , President Wahid and Vice President Megawati in this respect are subordinate .
in addition , it was revealed that Major-General Kirbiantoro , who is currently commander of the Greater Jakarta Military Region , was promoted to the rank of chief of staff of the Armed Forces as a result .
the move will also announce the new Air Force Chief of Staff , a popular candidate for the post of Yan Santoso , the defense counselor of the Indonesian Embassy in Singapore from 1991 to 1994 .
when the Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff were removed last Monday , Wahid did not change the Air Force Chief of Staff because he was not sure who would replace them .
Wahid had intended to upgrade outgoing Air Force Chief of Staff Hanafi Asnan to succeed Victor Dodo 's Commander-in-Chief , but when the decision was made a month ago , the Army was dissatisfied and a recent agreement was reached .

on Saturday , I went to the local university and church to hold the new year 's PARTY .
this year there are many people , crowded and hot .
the video of the Spring Festival Gala on the projection screen is boring .
after a while , I could see some excitement .
several plump white girls in cheongsam , the front of the searchlight , there is an impulse to say MARDI GRA when everyone loves to say : " show ME U BOOBS !
" ! "
but if the church heard me , I would probably have been expelled , sent to hell , and locked .
when I went to church in the south of the United States , it was quite different now .
China is really open and invigorating , and now the students are very fierce .
there are several vigorous dances , several Chinese students MM wearing black dance clothes , naked navel , twisted very well , attracting numerous eyes .
but the food was really bad , not mentioning it .
after the martial arts performance is the dance , 98 .
7 % dance blind , I took the child to the cool corner , as a WALLFLOWER .
at the beginning of the slow dance , Teresa Teng 's lingering voice brought me into an atmosphere .
I think of two people on the eve of this Valentine 's day .
first love .
her college classmates and my friend also sent a EMAIL on New Year 's day .
know her new situation and wish her happiness .
it is unavoidable to recall those days that are pure and pure .
you .
the only thing I want to think of is you .
seeing other people dancing , I imagined that if I were ten years younger , lingering with you on the dance floor , looking at your beautiful eyes , looking at your flushed cheeks , I would be really happy , but it seems like the end of the song , leaving only helpless me and the old age .
at this moment , do you feel the loneliness and loneliness in the noise ?
do you see when another person is so close to feel so distant ?
I 'm not Don Juan , you don 't seem to know yet .
it 's all my fault .
the bitterness of my heart , together with a handful of salt , will also crystallize the yearning and longing for you .
can you hear my silent whisper ?
at this time of deep moonlight , I feel an unprecedented loneliness and melancholy .
you 're don Juan ?
how many people can win the courage of Don Juan ?
love does not love you , will not change because of this .
maybe a few years later , the world will be totally different . everything that shouldn 't have been there will be eradicated , but it 's a pity that we won 't be able to live until we have to climb mountains and cross mountains .
that friend of yours , is she thoughtful , I guess it has something to do with her past experience .
forgive her . she will be more generous because she will only remember you .
maybe she regretted it in second days ?
you don 't know .
on Valentine 's morning , everything is in the clouds .
oh , almost forgot to charge !

the Daily Mail said British detectives and police scientists involved in the investigation of Princess Diana 's death would examine the car to find out what caused the accident in France in 1997 .

China has recently again refused to let the United States act as a mediator in cross-strait relations . now listen to VOA reporter Li Su .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhang Qiyue said Tuesday that China refuses to use the United States as a mediator in cross-strait relations .
" the Chinese people are fully capable of solving their own problems , and there is no need for other countries to participate in or intervene in the problem , " he said .
Zhang reiterated that there is only one China in the world and that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one country . he denied the news that China is prepared to soften its position on the one-China issue .
" no matter what happens , the one-China principle is the basis for maintaining stable and developing relations across the Taiwan Strait , " he said .
he called on the leaders of Taiwan to face the reality and improve cross-strait relations with practical actions .
Taiwan 's President Chen Shui-bian recently said that although the United States has said it will not act as a mediator between the two sides , he still believes that the United States can play a bridge role between the two sides .
Taiwan 's cross-strait relations cross-party group recently said that as long as the recognition of Taiwan 's constitution can meet Beijing 's one-China requirements .
the Constitution of Taiwan was formulated during the Kuomintang 's reign in 1947 . it does not mention a Chinese issue , but it shows that the territory of the Republic of China includes the mainland of China and Taiwan . because the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can not reach a consensus on a Chinese issue , the two sides have no responsibilities at present . what is the official contact ?
Beijing is now actively seeking cooperation among Taiwan 's opposition parties , the Kuomintang , the PPP and the New Party in this regard , in order to exert greater pressure on the Chen Shui-bian government .
Wu Boxiong , vice chairman of the Kuomintang , recently visited the Chinese mainland and met with top Chinese leaders .

Taiwan 's stock market has suffered a series of declines due to political instability , which has exerted tremendous pressure on the Taiwan government .

( new York General Electric ) Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian accused Daimler Chrysler of cheating shareholders when it bought Chrysler two years ago , preparing to claim more than $ 9 billion in compensation in addition to rehabilitating the independent management of Chrysler . US dollar ( around 15 billion 800 million Singapore dollars ) .
Cochran , 83 , the third largest shareholder of DaimlerChrysler , filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court , accusing DaimlerChrysler of " leading Chrysler shareholders to vote by fraud in 1998 " and describing the deal as an " equal merger . " the transaction " deliberately deceived " shareholders and other interested parties .
in his early years , Cochran became rich by running an airline that transported large numbers of passengers to Las Vegas casinos .
he started investing in Chrysler in 1990 and planned to acquire Chrysler in 1995 . he is now the third largest shareholder of Daimler Chrysler , holding about 4 % of Daimler Chrysler through his Trasinda Investment Company , totaling 33 million shares .
Daimler Benz , a German automaker , held a 13.75 % stake in Chrysler before acquiring Chrysler in the United States .
" Trasinda has been one of Chrysler 's major investors since 1990 and has always believed in Chrysler 's growth potential , but since Chrysler and Daimler , Trasinda has been one of Chrysler 's major investors , " said Cochrane 's attorney for Trasinda Investment . after Mercedes-Benz merged , the company turned to DaimlerChrysler and its share price has fallen by more than half .
the fall in share prices was linked to President Schlump 's actions to subdue , demote , and fire Chrysler 's long-time loyal employees , which depressed Chrysler 's morale and cost North American stock traders their shares . confidence . "
if he had known that Daimler Benz was going to buy Chrysler and demote it to a division of the Daimler Group and fire Chrysler executives , he would not have voted for the deal .
DaimlerChrysler was criticized for losing 579m in the third quarter , the biggest loss in years , as Chrysler 's business continued to lose money . last week it fired three senior U.S. employees and replaced them with Germans .
in an interview with the Financial Times , the chairman , Jurgen Schlump , simply admitted that what he said about the 1998 merger was an " equal merger " between the two German and American companies was actually a lie to get the shareholders 'meeting to approve the merger .
later he apologized publicly for these words .
Daimler Chrysler said in a statement from its Michigan headquarters that the company had not received a copy of the complaint , but that " there is clearly no justification for their accusation from the statement of Trasinda Investment Company . "

the success of Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore 's efforts to challenge the results of Florida 's elections now depends on how the Florida Supreme Court decides on Al Gore 's appeal .
but Gore 's only real hope of topping the White House may depend on two electoral lawsuits filed in two small counties .
the two lawsuits , filed by Democratic supporters , will be heard by a judge on the 6th .
in both cases , the plaintiff appealed to the judge to invalidate 25,000 correspondence tickets from Martin and Seminole .
with only one victory in the two-year case , Bush 's current 537-vote lead margin is set to vanish immediately .
as a result , the winner of the Florida election will become Gore , not George W. Bush , as Secretary of State Harris previously announced .
but the Bush camp is sure to appeal in both cases , because both counties are Republican candidates , and a 25,000-vote newsletter would surely add nearly 8,000 more votes to Gore 's vote if it was invalidated .
( Washington Consolidated ) As of the end of the week , Bush had the upper hand in most U.S. presidential polls , with rising female voter support being the main source of stimulus .
female voters were the group on which Vice President Gore had to win the election , and the double-digit advantage he had enjoyed had gradually shifted to parity with George W. Bush .
in every poll , as long as George W. Bush was able to split the women 's vote , he had the upper hand , because he had always been a leader among men .
the United States held presidential elections on Tuesday , November 7th .
according to a CNN-Time poll , George W. Bush led Gore by 49 % to 43 % , while the ABC News poll released the day before yesterday showed that George W. Bush had a 49 % to 45 % lead .
other polls show either that the two candidates are equal or that George W. Bush has the upper hand .
in the cable news network - Times poll , women voters gave each other half of the vote , and ABC News polls showed Gore six points ahead of women voters .
George W. Bush has a double-digit advantage in male voters .
the battle for state and Electoral College votes is still fierce --- although George W. Bush has broken through West Virginia 's traditional Democratic lead and dominated the campaign in the stronghold of Ohio .
in Minnesota , where Green Party candidate Nader holds 10 percent of the vote , Bush and Gore are on a par .
just as the two men fought for final victory , Clinton launched the only political task Gore 's campaign required of the president the day before yesterday : to mobilize black voters to vote in favor of Gore .
Clinton met about 150 black community leaders at the White House , one of the aims of which was to make black people more active in supporting Gore , because black voters were one of the Democratic trumps .
teachers in Philadelphia , on the other hand , went on strike for the first time since 1981 , following the breakdown of negotiations for higher pay and health benefits .
a third-grade student in Yiming , Kaohsiung , was threatened with 50 knife slaughter if he couldn 't get the money within the time limit . the student , fearing that he would report it to the school , received a response of one week at the training and punishment station .
a third-grade male student surnamed Xia in Yiming Middle School in Kaohsiung City was threatened and extorted by his classmates of the same grade on campus last week . he was asked to hand over 500 yuan within a time limit , otherwise he would be killed .
parents angrily complained to Kaohsiung City Councilor Jane Kim Cheng . his mother said the child was in a hurry to raise money everywhere , and finally told the school . instead , she was punished by the school for standing for a week . it was absolutely unreasonable .
" if you don 't give me the money , I 'll kill you with a martial arts knife and get cut off on my way to school .
I called her teacher , but she said why she didn 't talk to her parents .
because she said , because the parents are triad .
however , the school refuted that it was only two days before the victim was sent to the training office , and it was not a penalty .
" we don 't mean that . we want to isolate him and protect him . "
the school also said it had handed over threatened students to civilians in the hope of giving them another chance .
but the parents of the threatened students thought that the school had not handled it properly , and that such campus security was worrying .

for him , the days of university are boring and tasteless .
the school is a small and broken college in Harbin , the playground is not as big as his high school , and the classroom is not as bright as his high school .
most importantly , looking at it , there is hardly any girl who can surprise him .
in the first semester , the school graded entrance bonuses according to entrance scores , and his high school mistakes turned the old hen into a swan , giving him a silent first prize , 800 Oceans .
money comes and goes quickly , and a few meals are over .
besides , I bought a watch .
at this time , he also had a girlfriend in high school .
he wrote several love letters for her and copied numerous articles and articles for her , as long as he thought they were interesting , he correctly copied them and put them in her drawer .
over time , he couldn 't tell whether he really liked her or just wanted to find someone to talk to .
he failed in the middle school entrance examination and entered a senior high school in the county .
he scolded him for all her fuck in the whole day without showing him a good face .
no wonder , too , that woman , because of her family 's poverty and many white-faced people , always wished her children could give her a voice .
so when he was in high school , his pressure was invisible , and he wanted to hide .
for no reason to the girls copied almost two full semesters , to the second half of senior high school semester , math , physics and chemistry scores fell sharply .
he became more reticent and hardly spoke to anyone but a few friends .
in the summer vacation of sophomore year , some people knocked on the door early in the morning .
when he opened the door in a dim light , he was beaten by a face .
the old woman of his family , with a list in her hand , cried out in a hoarse voice , " You beast , you will not let me live .

on that list , I remember my physics scores : 26 , English : 59 , no comments .
that 's the lowest score mom has ever seen in his life .
that beating turned him into a nervous breakdown , and he began to wonder a lot of things for no reason ; a few steps out of the house would always turn around and confirm whether or not the door was locked , and every time the door was locked .
fortunately , the third year of the super high pressure has come . she is in the four class of senior three , liberal arts .
he went to science , class three of grade three , upstairs .
the article is no longer copied , and love letters are not written .
in addition to eating and going to the toilet every day , they are constantly practicing in the classroom .
in the math test , he took the second place in the whole class . the last recognized problem was solved by him and only by his step .
in physics examination , second of the class were named .
even at the whole class meeting , he said he was a key university student .
he felt happier and happier learning , and gradually forgot some of her things , though it was just going upstairs and downstairs .
later , she told him that she really liked him , but he was not .
he asked her why she didn 't come and talk to him , and she laughed and said , fool , where is a girl chasing a boy ?
that sentence made him feel that although two people had broken up , they still seemed to be together .
wherever he was , there were moments when the ripples of a pond blown by the wind shook people 's hearts .
in the last semester of his junior year , the night after the makeup exam , he told him that he was going to go back to her in high school .
he A borrowed 600 yuan from him .
not long after he had left home , he called her when he came home , but he didn 't see her .
both felt vaguely that it might be simpler , because it was not necessary .
he ran nearly 6000 miles back and forth , just for a moment of impulse to see her .
and the real reason is that she sent him a plush bear toy for his birthday and put a small note in the zipper on his back saying : happy birthday , kiss you .
in March of that year , he did not know what it was like to kiss a girl she liked .
Beijing , Oct. 1 ( Xinhua News Agency ) " China Sports Daily " published today published an article entitled " do your best . " the full text is as follows : although women 's long-distance runner Li Ji won the seventh place in the 10,000-meter race , but she has created her own best results . .
the Chinese sports delegation was satisfied , and she herself was satisfied , because she " did her best " .

although the Chinese sports delegation has won 28 gold medals and the " second chair " on the medal list has not reached the end , the party and the government are satisfied and the people are satisfied . Similarly , the Chinese sports delegation has " done its best " .
in the Olympic arena , it is not only a technical contest , but also a contest of spirit , will and quality in many cases .
some teams could have played better , but they didn 't work hard enough , lacking the conviction that every point must be won , and they collapsed .
some athletes in the game was in the advantage , but the critical moment tends to conservative , their own burden on their own , the result is lost .
therefore , it is very reasonable not to judge the hero by his success or failure . the key lies in whether he has surpassed himself and exerted his best level .
we should praise them and applaud them even if we didn 't win the medal .
" do your best " is the embodiment of will and character , but also a spirit .
if all the sports and athletes " do their best " , our sports will have a new leap .

Lanzhou , Dec. 19 , Xinhua News Agency , Lanzhou , Xinhua News Agency : " top Poverty Alleviation " Wang Zaihai , Xinhua News Agency reporter Cai Hui , Xinhua News Agency , Xianggang Er as a representative of the human and military system , Fuping County , Shaanxi Province , political commissar Wang Zaihairong , ranked as the " Top Poverty Alleviation " in the country .
Wang is well deserved .
in the past three years , he led military cadres to help poor villages build roads and schools , divert water and power , develop agriculture through science and technology , and develop diversified economy . the per capita grain production in the village has increased from 200 kg in 1996 to more than 450 kg , and the per capita income has increased from 265 yuan to over 450 kg . 1000 yuan .
Fuping County has a Beiyu village , high mountains and deep ditches , lack of water and electricity , the village 's 146 households have 51 families are extremely poor .
Wang Zaihai chose to link up with Beiyu Village , the poorest village in the county , when the " August 7 Poverty Alleviation Project " was implemented .
he said that we should rely on the Party 's policy of enriching the people , by giving full play to our own advantages , and build a socialist new mountain village in this remote and remote area .
in 1997 , Wang Zaihai led the working group across mountains and mountains , visited more than 400 families , and helped formulate the " Three-year Plan for Poverty Alleviation in Beiyu Village " and the " Plan for Sustainable Economic Development in Beiyu Village " , which was affirmed by the local Party committees , the government and the military divisions . .
Beiyu Village per capita arable land is less than 0.9 mu , most of the villagers are short of grain for more than four months a year , rely on reimbursement relief to survive .
in view of this situation , Wang Zaihai mobilized the masses to carry out farmland infrastructure construction . after a winter 's struggle , 60 mu of land was reclaimed , reaching the per capita standard of one mu , making more than 80 mu of medium and low yield fields into stable and high yield fields .
when the peasants got a bumper harvest , they solved the problem of eating .
Beiyu Village has many hillsides . Wang Zaihai proposed that the mountain should be used to support the people and turn waste into treasure . he hired technicians to teach the villagers the techniques of planting pepper , persimmon and locust .
six months ago , the whole village planted more than 240 mu of Zanthoxylum bungeanum , with an annual income of over 10 yuan .
in the ten years ' drought in the North Valley Village , the villagers suffered a lot for water .
5 times , Wang went back to the mountains with the village cadres and water conservancy personnel to inspect the water quality .
during this period , his gallstone syndrome and premature heart beats continued to break out , and he took his medicine wherever he went .
during a construction , Wang Zaihai , who had not rested for several nights , died of fatigue and illness , was carried down the hill for treatment . tears fell from everyone present .
but on the second day he was better and rushed to the mountain again .
Kung Fu does not bear the heart of the people , Ganquan finally led to the foot of the mountain , round the dream of the ancestors of Beiyu Village .
Wandeng Mountain is called " Jinshan " by people . it contains a large number of sapphire , inkstone and other resources .
but because they are too poor to develop , the masses are holding the " golden bowl " without food , guarding the " golden mountain " without money to spend .
Wang Zaihai saw in his eyes , anxious in his mind , more than 30 times on foot on-the-spot inspections of the new stone products market survey .
in May 1997 , through coordination of various aspects , the " Fuping Wandengshan Laowu Stone Development Co . , Ltd . " was founded , and a stone finishing production line was established . in Xi 'an , Xianyang and other places , inkstone exhibition halls and sales windows were set up . at present , the products are far away . selling 18 provinces and municipalities , the jade products have become " national treasures " .
while China is concerned about the Indian Ocean disaster , there are also many accusations that some government departments are too enthusiastic about fund-raising or media hype .
some netizens have criticized the mentality of local governments competing with each other . not only are rich provinces encouraging residents to donate money , but even poor provinces are " not falling behind " and are " launching large-scale fund-raising campaigns " to organs , factories , mines , enterprises and schools .
did China donate too little to the tsunami victims in India , or too much ?
in recent days , this issue has aroused heated debate among many Chinese people on the Internet .
after the earthquake and tsunami that had been the only in decades in the Indian Ocean 10 days ago , China immediately announced that it would provide $ 2.6 million in aid to the affected countries .
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao promised 500 million yuan or more in aid when he met with the ambassadors and representatives of international organizations in Beijing on Friday .
in addition , under the leadership of the Chinese government , the Chinese people have also launched an unprecedented donation boom . people from all walks of life are generous and the media are full of good news : in Beijing , a 78-year-old woman will have only 1,800 yuan on her hands . Renminbi was donated in cash ; 81 poor mountain pupils took out 1 yuan each from their meager living expenses and sent it to the disaster area to their teachers ; it is said that many unemployed and laid-off workers were among the donors in Liaoning .
through these reports , the official media constantly convey the message that China is a responsible power .
in a commentary , the Jiangnan Times , sponsored by the People 's Daily , said that after the Indian Ocean tsunami , disaster-stricken countries were looking forward to other people 's help , " testing true and false friends . " China 's unswerving donation is " the embodiment of a true friend " and " the embodiment of a true friend " . the performance of a responsible country .
" people 's Daily " reported that victims of the disaster to participate in the rescue operation of Chinese officials praised " China is a great country " and " the Chinese rescue team 's medical assistance capacity is the strongest .
and the headline of Xinhua 's home page yesterday afternoon was " The international community praises China 's relief action against the Indian Ocean tsunami " .
however , while the whole country is concerned about the Indian Ocean disaster , there are also many accusations that some government departments are too enthusiastic about fund-raising or media hype .
some netizens have criticized the mentality of local governments competing with each other . not only are rich provinces encouraging residents to donate money , but even poor provinces are " not falling behind " and are " launching large-scale fund-raising campaigns " to organs , factories , mines , enterprises and schools .
in foreign countries , donations are often made by means of telephone hotlines and street collections . donors are more spontaneous , but the main way to raise money in China is for government agencies and institutions to mobilize employees to donate money . it is clear who has donated how much . as a result , some unwilling donors have to make some symbolic gestures under pressure .
the Chinese government 's response to the Indian Ocean tsunami has been criticized by the US media over this period of time .
last Thursday , the Asian Wall Street Journal alluded to China 's reputation as a good neighbor and partner of Asian countries . the region suffered such a catastrophe , but China donated only $ 2.6 million , about the same amount as Kuwait , with only Taiwan . half of the bay is " even less than the amount promised by Hong Kong businessman Ka-shing Lee alone " .
the New York Times still compares the $ 350 million and $ 500 million donated by the United States and Japan to show that " the world 's most populous country is still far from being the biggest in Asia " after China 's official aid was added to $ 62 million .
some netizens say that China is not the boss , but a developing country . it does not need to be a tough man under the pressure of the international media , because it is too eager to show up and compete with other countries to make a show of benevolence .
however , some people point out that this generation of Chinese people has been educated by the government to handle all social affairs since childhood . many people have no sense of giving back to the society and seldom think about what they can contribute to the society . the donation campaign is a good mass education . activity .
an elementary school in Shanghai has mobilized students to organize a charity show to donate money to victims of the Indian Ocean .
the principal of the primary school said the purpose of the event was to " teach children to care for others " .

Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , October 1 ( Reporter Li Yu ) More than 120 people from the Catholic circle in Beijing , led by Fu Tieshan , chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association and bishop of the Beijing Diocese , came down to Tiananmen Square this morning to watch the solemn flag raising ceremony .
among the Catholic circles celebrating New China 's 51st birthday with people from all walks of life in the motherland , there are not only the old generation of clergymen who came from the anti-imperialist patriotic movement in the 1950s , but also the new generation of clergymen after the reform and opening up .

prior to the flag-raising ceremony , Bishop Fu Tieshan told reporters that the Holy See will hold a ceremony in Rome today for the so-called " saints " who will be awarded the title of 120 " lethal in China " .
this activity violated the church procedures , ignored the sovereignty of the Chinese Catholic Church , and was " holy " by some foreign missionaries in the history of serious harm to the interests of the Chinese people .
the Chinese Catholic Church expresses its grave concern and indignation at this disregard of the sovereignty of Chinese Catholicism and a distorted and falsified activity in the modern history of China .

we hope that at the turn of the new millennium and the new century , the Holy See will change its policy of hostility to China , refrain from making historical mistakes , repent of the mistakes made by the Chinese people in history , and refrain from setting new ground for the improvement of Sino-Vatican relations . obstacles .
if the Holy See persistently takes a hostile attitude towards China , it will cause even greater losses to the evangelization of Chinese Catholicism .
Fu Tieshan said that in modern Chinese history , Chinese Catholicism , the Holy church , was used by imperialism and colonialism .
since the founding of New China , we have resolutely held high the banner of patriotism and religion , adhered to the principle of running churches independently and independently , and gained the understanding of all the Chinese people for the church .
over the past 50 years , the Chinese Catholic Church , together with its compatriots of all ethnic groups , has contributed to the prosperity and strength of New China and to the building of the country 's material and spiritual civilization .
following the flag-raising ceremony , Bishop Fu Tieshan held a Mass of Thanksgiving at Xuanwumen Church of the Catholic Church in Beijing , praying for the 51st birthday of New China and for the happiness of the people of the whole country and the prosperity of New China .
the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Church , the bishops and priests of the Chinese Catholic Church and the priests of the Chinese Catholic Church in Beijing participated in the ceremony .

Xinhua News Agency , Lanzhou , Dec. 27 : why did Lanzhou indoor swimming pool close for visitors Hu Meijuan , a reporter from Xinhua News Agency , originally wanted to make money by winter in Lanzhou indoor swimming pool ? because of repeated investment and disorderly competition , most of the indoor swimming pools have closed their doors to thank visitors , and they have experienced a blind coaxing . after that , it was caught in a dilemma .
in 1996 , the world of bathing music , which was rebuilt by old factory buildings , was open to the outside world .
as the first indoor swimming pool in Lanzhou City , the world of swimming and music once witnessed an explosion of overcrowding , with a daily turnover of more than 30,000 yuan in winter , and all the investment was recovered that year .
in order to make it convenient for people to swim in the world of swimming and music , the Lanzhou Bus Company has set up the terminal of the two special line buses here .
Lanzhou tax authorities also classified indoor swimming pools as places for national fitness rather than entertainment , and levied a 3.3 % preferential tax rate to support the development of indoor swimming pools .
the boom in the world of swimming and music has made it fashionable for many investors to look for indoor swimming pools for gold .
since 1997 , many indoor swimming pools in Lanzhou have been competing with each other through bank loans , self-financing or attracting foreign investment . in 1998 alone , a new indoor swimming pool opened every three months . at present , there are nine large indoor swimming pools in Lanzhou . it can receive about 100 thousand swimmers a day .
indoor swimming pools in Lanzhou from a single show after a sudden burst of rapid expansion , had to fall into a bleak business situation .
in order to attract swimmers , Lanzhou 's indoor swimming pools have fought a price war . the hourly swimming fee has been reduced from 10 yuan to 5 yuan per person . in cities like Urumqi and Hohhot , where the economic development level is similar , the fee is more than 20 yuan .
in the face of fierce market competition , some indoor swimming pools even find another " shortcut " to develop such as swimming with unhealthy colors of business .
at present , the indoor swimming pool in Lanzhou is closed for all kinds of reasons except for two normal operations .
in the world of swimming and music , the reporter saw the glass door of the entrance and exit was locked , and a thick layer of dust had accumulated on the door . the nearby vendors , who used to be mainly used for swimming goods , had switched to small department stores .
according to the owner of a small shop , the world of swimming and music closed in October , mainly because there were too few swimmers .
it is reported that the Lanhai swimming pool , which is still open as usual , has less than 300 swimmers a day , earning only about 1,000 yuan , and has been operating at a loss for several months .
Lanhai swimming pool manager Deng Jinghui believes that the indoor swimming pool as a relatively high-end fitness venue , the early investment in more than 10 million yuan .
in order to ensure constant water temperature and room temperature , to ensure clean water quality , but also into large-scale cold and warm air systems and chemicals , Lanzhou indoor swimming pool is currently operating at less than 600 yuan a day , more than 4000 yuan .
in a city with only 1.6 million citizens , only a thousand frequent swimmers and only 4 to 5 yuan an hour for swimming , the development of indoor swimming pools in Lanzhou is much faster than the growth of residents 'income and the change of consumption habits . market competition is bound to be a must . but forcing some indoor swimming pools to close down and some gold diggers to invest in the water .
in view of the present situation , Deng Jinghui appeals to investors who intend to reinvest in indoor swimming pools to make careful choices . at the same time , he also suggests that the education department should change the traditional playground-style physical education mode and take indoor swimming pools as the second classroom of physical education to promote swimming among primary and secondary school students . fitness , fitness , promote growth and development and other functions of sports .

doctors at clinics in Kaohsiung and Tainan are conducting a rare connection against a criminal who has threatened 29 doctors and clinics , but this time there is no doctor or hospital . willing to pay compensation , and said it will fight to the end .
and the police hope to catch him quickly .
the dentist , who opened his business in Kaohsiung 's Qianzheng District , was recently upset because he received a threatening letter from a gangster demanding a toll .
the letter was clearly typed out on a computer , because the police wanted money , or they would shoot and throw petrol bombs , so that dentists are at their own risk .
" we spend money on disaster . we can 't do that . "
doctors reacted to the union to reach a consensus that no one should pay for killing , and to call the police .
the Municipal Police College 's Inquisitorial Unit also carefully fingerprinted the threatening letter . only the remittance account and the amount of extortion were handwritten . the amount was small , indicating that doctors were required to spend money on disaster relief .
doctors are frightened by this kind of public order . some dental clinics are equipped with special surveillance devices . they are not afraid of 10,000 , just in case .
" through this we have installed surveillance devices to try to prevent robberies . "
there were more than a dozen similar cases of intimidation against dentists in Tainan last month , which police believe are of considerable relevance .
instead of targeting specific targets , the gangsters used telephone directories to select dentists as targets of intimidation .
at present , a Yang surnamed suspect is locked .

Eleven members of the Taiwan tour group , who were slightly injured in a serious car accident in Canada , flew back to Taipei early this morning on a Chinese flight .
the first family members arrived in Vancouver after a series of twists and turns , arriving in Zilerna , an hour 's drive from Vancouver , to visit injured families in hospitals around the city .
Li Shikun and Fan Zhiming , who had lost their wives in the crash , are now facing the toughest task of appeasing their six-year-old sons , Li Yuebo and Fan Duanmin , who were injured at the same time .
" he may be talking a lot , a lot of a little friend , he was very sad to lose his mother . "
" we must never leave again . "
the family members of the second group arrived in Vancouver today , including Zhang Xiangting , whose granddaughter was placed in the city hospital .
" although everybody takes care of her here , she certainly wants her loved ones around her . "
Zhong Hua Fang , an interview with Vancouver , Canada .
special report : the road to the special zone .
" communication and integration " , the central station reporter Du Changhua and Shi Min .
on the expressway from Shenzhen Airport to downtown area , the reporter saw the vehicles with licenses from Hong Kong and Shenzhen shuttling and trucks transporting goods from various parts of Guangdong Province were also in front of Louvre Customs .
in Lo Wu District , near Hong Kong , most of the new residential buildings are Hong Kong residents .
1 / 10 sold in buildings sold in Shenzhen last year was bought by Hongkong people .
an important consideration for Comrade Deng Xiaoping to set up the Special Zone 20 years ago is to make use of the geographical advantages of Xiamen , Shenzhen and Zhuhai to make the Special Zone a bridgehead for contacts between the mainland and Taiwan , Hong Kong and Macao , in preparation for the peaceful reunification of the motherland .
Shenzhen is adjacent to Hongkong and is at the junction point of realizing " one country , two systems " .
the establishment and development of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone is of strategic importance to the smooth return , prosperity and stability of Hong Kong .
the special economic zones have adopted a flexible management system and special preferential policies to attract a large number of foreign and Hong Kong businessmen to invest in three-capital enterprises . at present , 70-80 % of Shenzhen 's foreign capital comes from Hong Kong . Hong Kong and the mainland have also formed a cooperative state of complementary advantages , mutual benefit and common development . potential .
Hong Kong and Macao make greater use of the rich resources and vast market of the mainland through the springboard role of Shenzhen and Zhuhai .
at present , most of the necessities such as fresh water , milk , poultry and vegetables in Hong Kong are supplied by Shenzhen .
the remarkable achievements made in Shenzhen in the past 20 years and the general improvement of people 's lives have greatly increased the confidence and centripetal force of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots in the socialist motherland .
in the past 20 years , the Xiamen SAR has also undertaken more difficult communication tasks in the two relationships .
Eighty percent of Taiwan 's compatriots are from Fujian , and Xiamen is the nearest part of the mainland to Taiwan .
at the end of the 1980s , when cross-strait relations began to thaw , Xiamen , which had the closest geographical and psychological distance , naturally became the first stop for Taiwan compatriots to land .
before 1990 , half of Taiwan compatriots 'investment enterprises in the mainland were in Xiamen , and more than half of Taiwan compatriots travelling between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were in Xiamen .
Xiamen Special Economic Zone has also made full use of this advantage to formulate a number of preferential policies for Taiwanese businessmen in investment . it has developed and constructed Jimei , Xinglin and Haitang three investment zones for Taiwanese businessmen , and has become the region with the largest number of Taiwanese investment zones and the most intensive investment by Taiwanese businessmen in the mainland of China .
Haitang , the largest Taiwanese investment zone with a planned area of 100 square kilometers , is the new urban area of Xiamen in the future .
Haitang New Harbor , which can berth the world 's largest container ship , is becoming a hot spot for strategic investment by the world 's shipping giants .
the 4th China Investment and Trade Fair just concluded in Xiamen attracted nearly 200 large Taiwanese enterprise groups including Longyu Group , Unified Group , Acer Computer and nearly 4000 Taiwanese businessmen .
the scale of Taiwanese exhibitors is large , with a large number of people .
a Taiwanese politician who visited Xiamen recently said , " Xiamen 's economy has lagged behind Taiwan 's Jiayi for 10 years , and now it is at least five years ahead of it . "
Taiwan 's economic chips against reunification have become increasingly insignificant in the rapid development of the mainland .
Utilizing special economic zones to promote the reunification of the motherland is the mission entrusted to the special economic zones by the motherland and a great pioneering work .
in the Special Administrative Region , we have clearly heard the rumble of the wheel of history of the reunification of the motherland .
the Hong Kong Airport Authority yesterday agreed to take a stake in a busy airport in the mainland , marking an important step in Hong Kong 's role in meeting the growing transport needs of the mainland .
... The Hong Kong Airport Authority announced that it had reached an agreement to form a joint venture with Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport Co .
Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport is located in a busy business district 112 miles from Shanghai .
the two sides said the Hong Kong Airport Authority would acquire a 25-49 % stake in Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport Limited , but other details , including the price , have not been determined .
Hong Kong also benefited from a surge in passenger and freight traffic driven by China 's fast-growing economy and looser travel restrictions , which set a new record for passenger and freight traffic in 2004 .
but Hong Kong 's traditional status as a gateway to the mainland is also facing challenges as the number of direct flights between mainland cities and destinations around the world has doubled .
Choosing a foothold in Hangzhou may be a way for Hongkong to attract tourists from mainland China .
David Pang , Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Airport Authority , said the cooperation with Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport Company Limited gave Hong Kong a better chance to participate in the mainland market and to unite with mainland airports .
he said that if the transaction is completed , Hong Kong will play a role in the management , corporate governance and airport construction of Xiaoshan in Hangzhou .
he also pointed out that the Hongkong Airport Authority will seek to form alliances with other mainland airports in the future .
Peng Ding said the negotiations with Hangzhou lasted for several months , and the final agreement will not be reached in the next few months .
the transaction also needs approval from the mainland authorities .
the deal comes as the Hongkong Airport Authority expects to seek listing as early as this year .
analysts said the deal could enhance the growth potential of the Hongkong airport authority .
I think the airport will get a stake in Hong Kong Airport , which provides a platform for the development of Xiaoshan Airport .
I think the airport should be expanded this year , and the scale should be larger .
Xinhua News Agency , Berlin , November 1 : Schroeder visited the Middle East Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Yongluhong , German Chancellor Schroeder visited Egypt , Lebanon , Jordan , Syria , Israel and the Palestinian Autonomous Region from October 28 to November 1 .
Schroeder 's visit , though hasty , was particularly noteworthy because it was the first visit to the Middle East by European Union leaders since the outbreak of serious Palestinian-Israeli conflict more than a month ago .
Schroder was preparing to visit the countries and regions a year ago .
whether the visit should be cancelled because of the renewed tension in the Middle East has aroused heated debate within the Schroeder group .
Schroeder also made a phone call to French President Jacques Chirac .
finally , Schroder resolutely decided to visit as usual .
German officials pointed out that Schroeder did not travel to the Middle East as a " mediator " because this role is beyond the German national strength , but Germany can not " ignore " the Palestinian-Israeli conflict .
the trip to the Middle East was designed to demonstrate the " strong interest " of Germany and the European Union in promoting peace in the Middle East .
during his visit , Schroeder repeatedly urged the parties concerned to return to the negotiating table , saying that Germany will continue to provide support and assistance for peace in the Middle East .
Schroder also strongly appealed to both Palestinians and Israelis to take immediate measures to stop the bloodshed .
in private talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak , he expressed " unease " about Israel 's actions in the conflict .
after talks with Palestinian leader Arafat , Schroeder , on the one hand , expressed the EU 's support for Palestine 's right to self-determination and statehood , on the other hand , hoped that the Palestinian side would avoid " unilateral action " .
he also promised that Germany would do something substantial to ease the conflict , including rescuing Israeli soldiers kidnapped in Lebanon shortly before and receiving some Palestinian wounded .
during his visits to Egypt and Jordan , he praised the moderate policies pursued by the two leaders and hoped that they would continue to play a role in the Middle East peace process .
Schroeder 's visit to Lebanon and Syria was the first visit by the German Chancellor to the two countries in years , indicating a marked improvement in their relations with Germany .
the reason why Germany is so concerned about the Middle East peace process is closely related to Germany 's interests in the region .
the Middle East is a potentially huge market in Germany .
Schroeder had planned to lead a large economic delegation to the Middle East , but had to change the plan temporarily because of the deterioration of the situation there .
the Middle East is also an important supplier of oil to Germany and other European countries . nearly 30 % of German crude oil demand now comes from the Middle East .
in addition , the Middle East is adjacent to Europe , and the unrest in the Middle East is bound to have a serious negative impact on Germany .
therefore , Schroeder stressed that if the conflict between Palestine and Israel continues , any side " will not be the winner " .
Schroeder 's trip to the Middle East also shows that the EU wants to play a bigger role in the Middle East .
at present , the Arab countries are calling for the European Union to play a greater role in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because the United States clearly protects Israel .
the European Union , in order to demonstrate that it is an important pole in today 's world structure , has a strong sense of playing a role in the Middle East peace process .
officials of the EU and its member states have repeatedly expressed their wish to contribute to peace in the Middle East and have strengthened coordination in this regard .
public opinion here believes that although Schroeder 's mediation in the Middle East has yielded limited results , as the leader of an important EU country , Schroeder personally feels the urgency of mediating the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and sends a clear message to the region that Germany and the EU are willing to work for peace in the Middle East . the signal itself is of positive significance .

Los Angeles , November 6 ( Xinhua News Agency ) ( Reporter Zhang Xiaojun ) The latest research shows that the use of hormone replacement therapy for women can reduce the long-term mental impairment caused by stroke .
at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Rehabilitation and Human Medicine , researchers at the Canary Rehabilitation Hospital in Tennessee presented their findings .
a survey of 137 women found that women who had used hormone replacement therapy before their first stroke scored higher on post-stroke intelligence tests than the average stroke woman .
although the mechanism of the effects of hormone replacement therapy on the human brain is unclear , experiments have shown that estrogen can protect memory and other cognitive abilities of the human brain .
at present , many middle-aged women use hormone replacement therapy to relieve menopausal symptoms , prevent heart disease and osteoporosis .
however , it is unclear whether this treatment is related to the incidence of breast cancer in women and whether it causes other health problems .

at the same time , U.S. Secretary of State Albright said : " Israel and Palestine agreed in principle to send negotiators to Washington after the end of the violent conflict in order to restart the Middle East peace talks . "
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said : " Arab leaders will hold a summit later this month to discuss the question of Palestine . "
Huang Maoshu , the principal of the new Chinese Academy of Sciences in Taiwan , who took over more than a month ago , has been accused of dual nationality before he was formally inaugurated .
currently in the United States , he said he was sorry to have caused a lot of trouble to schools and the Department of Education because he didn 't understand the domestic laws .
the Office of the new president of Taichung University has been singing " empty city " since the beginning of the school . this is not because the candidate of the new president is still up in the air , but because the new president , Huang Maoshu , is also a vice president of the University of North Science and Technology in the United States .
in fact , as early as the end of July , the appointment of Vice President of the United States University of Science and Technology has been in the hands of Huang Maoshu , and the post of president of the Taichung New College was mentioned in mid-August before the appointment of Huang Maoshu .
Huang Maoshu had to ask for leave of absence from the school first under the circumstance of separate magic on both sides . as a result , who knows if the leave is correct , but he still violated the law that civil servants must not have dual nationality .
" you have to ask for leave to come to this place first , because it 's awkward there , so take it as a position , then this side is in a state of asking for leave , so it doesn 't guide the spirit of this side . "
although he refused to help with his dual nationality as early as August 16 , there was no penalty , said Huang Maoshu , a native of the United States , who respects the decision of domestic authorities .
but the teachers and students of Taichung New College have already hoped to see the new principal return to school in mid-October .
more than 40,000 fraudulent letters have been sent to the mailbox in Matsuhara , Taichung County , in the last week . police officers have preliminarily concluded that the group may be worried about the possibility of sending large numbers of mail to the post office . record the appearance , so deliberately put in the mail box in the suburb to avoid the police 's arrest .
there was a tall cage full of winning letters sent by the Scraper fraud group . the post office staff cooperated with the police to find out that every opening was a BM leaflet and a raffle card . hundreds of thousands of cash had been drawn from both the number and the scrape . .
the postal market in the Kowloon area of Matsuhara , Taichung County , has recently taken back a large number of suspicious printed matter and mail from the mailboxes in the suburbs almost every day . the intuitive reaction is scrape-and-scrape fraud letters . it was unexpected that more than 40,000 fraudulent letters were received by the Matsuhara Post Office within a week . therefore , it is urgent to deal with it .
" it 's normal for him to take bulk mail to the post office , but he actually put it in the mailbox with stamps , and the amount is quite large , which is a bit suspicious . "
the police have ruled that the fraudulent group is in trouble to avoid the obvious goal of delivering bulk mail , or even being recorded . stamps are posted one after another to the suburban mailboxes to be distributed , but the General Post Office has authorized the city to put warnings on fraudulent letters . the main content of the negotiation is that if the recipient has to pay a winning deposit or remittance , he must suspect that it is a trap set up by a fraud group and should take extra care to avoid being deceived .
although the decision-making process for the suspension of the test was curious , Li Yongzhe , president of the Chinese Academy of Research , said he had no prior knowledge of it , but since he was a cross-party panel convener , the afternoon meeting would further discuss what to do next in the country .
the new government said it would not build a nuclear test . as the head of the country 's highest academic research unit , Li Yongzhe , Dean of the Academy of Central Research , had no prior knowledge of the new government 's decision .
" there are many opinions to be discussed . "
the impact of the suspension of nuclear testing even found Li Yongzhe . before the beginning and the end of the matter could not be understood , Li Yongzhe maintained a consistent attitude not to say much or not to say much .
but from his performance in the morning , even though he wore the traditional Shao costume and listened to the traditional Shao music , his expression was as tight as ever without a smile .
although it was rainy in the morning , the third opening of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the public this morning attracted an endless stream of people . however , Li Yongzhe , as the host , could not give these people a warm response to the nuclear test suspension and cross-strait issues .
it continues to be an important news on the mainland and in the world .
first of all , let 's look at the news of cross-strait cooperation in combating crime .
the Criminal Police Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior will send five officers to the mainland next year to cooperate with Chinese public security in combating crimes on both sides of the Taiwan Strait under the name of cracking down on drug-related crimes . News of the arrest in Shanghai , mainland China .
the investigation section of the Criminal Police Bureau has written to the Taiwan Exchange Foundation to ask the SEF to coordinate the cross-strait relations between the mainland and the mainland to repatriate Yang Guangnan , the leader of the Sihai Gang who was arrested by the Chinese Communist Party 's public security .
Gao Zhengsheng , head of the investigation section of the Criminal Bureau , said that although the Shanghai Foundation had not been informed by the Mainland China Sea Association about the arrest of Yangguangnan and other underworld elements by the Chinese Communist Party public security in Shanghai , the investigation by the criminal team through private channels in the future has confirmed that Yang Guangnan was arrested in Shanghai . .
Yang Guangnan was arrested for the first time in Shanghai in March last year . it was pointed out that when he was transferred to the Golden Age Hotel after attending the wedding of the relatives of Senior Jia of the Sihai Band , he met Tiandao League , the province 's leading position in the hotel .
as the two sides had a knot in mind to seize Shanghai 's territory in the early days , there was another outbreak of displeasure between the talks , and a big fight broke out .
Shanghai police seized them and Yang Guangnan was deported to Macau .
Yang Guangnan , the leader of the Sihai Gang , was arrested again in Shanghai . the news on the way pointed out that the reason why Yang Guangnan was locked in by the mainland police was directly related to his frequent disputes between the gangs in the mainland .
in addition , there was a murder in Taoyuan City . a man died more than three days after falling down a building . he still has a knife in his hand .
because the building where the deceased fell was often attacked by thieves , the police initially judged that he might have fallen to death accidentally when he was stealing .
Peasant Bank of China in Taoyuan City has always had a busy front door , but strangely in the morning , a man who had died for more than three days was found in a fire alley next door to it .
the deceased , Zhong Qiwu , 56 years old , was found holding a dagger tightly in his hand and naked .
police found a rope at the air-conditioning window on the ninth floor and a rusty hammer .
as residents and administrators in the vicinity said , there have been frequent burglaries in recent buildings , and three days ago , a silver and gold club on the eighth floor was also stolen .
police preliminary study found that the deceased and his accomplices sneaked into the building to steal , not from the ninth floor to fall .
his accomplices , however , did not see the situation and abandoned him for fleeing the scene .
as for the details of the case , the police need further in-depth investigation .
Canadian Liberal Prime Minister Clayton won a landslide election Monday in a parliamentary overwhelming government , with opposition parties in different regions getting different votes .
listen to reports from VOA correspondent MacCulloch from Vancouver .
Prime Minister Chretian won 173 out of 301 seats in the Canadian House of Representatives , four opposition parties won the remaining 128 seats respectively , and the formal opposition party , the Canadian Reformist Party , won 66 seats , taking second place in Parliament .
the Right-wing Reformist Party won a majority from the four western provinces of Maimitoba , Saskatchewan , Alberta and British Columbia .
the Quebec Group won 37 seats in the conservative Quebec Parliament , and the Quebec Group fought for Quebec 's secession from Canada .
the New Left Democratic Party won 13 seats and won the support of voters in the western and eastern provinces of Canada .
the once powerful Progressive Conservative Party now holds only 12 seats , mostly from the eastern provinces of Newfoundland , Nova Scotia and New Brunswick .
Desperate to win votes in the central and eastern provinces of Canada , the reformist leader , Stokoville Day , said he would cooperate with the Liberal government but would object if necessary .
" Chrydian has won the right and the trust to rule , and I will continue to work with the government as the leader of the opposition on what I think is good for the country , and against him on what I think is bad for the country , " said Stokoville Dai .
conservative leader Clark , who served nine months as prime minister in 1979 and 1980 , feels divided by region and hopes that politics will not undermine Canadian unity .
" there are still huge divisions in our country , and the new parliament still reflects these divisions . politics of divisions is still a very big temptation , whether it 's between the East and the West , or between the rich and the poor , or between English and French , " Clark said . without partisanship , politics cannot exist , but we must not forget that partisanship must not go beyond Canada 's national interests .
" Collaboration between the opposition parties may not happen , especially between the Conservatives and the coalition parties , which are mainly composed of people who are divorced from the Conservatives , " said Victoria University political scientist Thomas Chua .
" they fight each other like mad dogs , they hate each other , the Conservatives and the coalition have great resentment against each other , one side wants to destroy the other , so they don 't cooperate , " he said .
the Quebec clique is a separatist party committed to making Quebec a sovereign state , so they have a common interest , apart from hating the Liberals .
" Canada will survive from the current parliament because regional parties have always been part of Canadian politics and have not harmed national unity , " Cai said .
" this may be a sign that the separatist movement has been weakened , " said Cai .

this incident is related to my series of misfortunes over the past more than 10 years .
my son died on December 21 , 1991 , my 12-year-old son almost died again , and my uncle died on December 20 . "

Xinhua News Agency , Istanbul , Nov. 5 ( Xinhua News Agency , Istanbul ) - China 's women 's chess team 's chances of defending the championship were estimated to be about 60 % before they went to Istanbul to win the championship .
what is the situation now ?
at the end of the seventh round , both China and Georgia took the lead one time and several times in parallel . they performed the " double Phoenix winning the pearl " in 86 women 's teams .
after the collapse of the Soviet Union , the Georgian team , which took over the flag of the Women 's Chess Kingdom , won three Olympic Championships in 1992 , 1994 and 1996 , mainly by the former Soviet women 's team .
in this competition , Georgia replaced Alahamia with two-time world youth champion Korhodez .
the card was right . Kirschner was 6-1 in seven innings . it was a good breakup .
in the match against the last third-place Russian team , the last runner-up , Georgia , won by a clear margin of 2.5-0.5 , giving the team a certain psychological advantage .
compared with Georgia 's aggressive momentum of swearing back the Villa Minchik mobile trophy , the Chinese women 's team , the previous champion and the top seed of the tournament , has also played its level well and is now one point ahead of the former .
the advantage and disadvantage of the two teams lies in that the fourth set of Gulliere is always " soft " , this year is no exception ; and the number one main player , former world champion Chiboldanizer , despite his skillful skills , but also defeated Russian team leader Garia Mova 's impressive record ; After several rounds of defeats to Yugoslav star Maric and Dutch former Chinese ace Peng Zhaoqin , the Ge team appeared to be a little stretched and unable to arrange the formation .

despite widespread scepticism and criticism of Sunday 's presidential election in Ivory Coast , many Ivorians see the election as a crucial step towards multi-party democracy in African countries .

a 25-year-old student said : " the Ivorian people 's front line is the only real opposition and the only political party that can bring about the changes he needs in Ivory Coast . "

the student condemned international organizations who decided not to send election observers .
he added : " the international community 's view is that this vote in Ivory Coast is not legitimate , so they do not send observers to add credibility to the process .
but we believe that our elections will be transparent and fair .
because the Ivorian people know what they are doing ? "
" even if we don 't have outside support , what do we know is happening in this country ? " he said .

a voter from Mann , Ivory Coast , said he supported the people 's right to boycott elections .
but he believes that this is not the best way to do so , given that this is a crucial moment for the country to strive for multi-party democracy .
" this is the first time that there are five candidates in the presidential election in Ivory Coast , and it is at least a step toward democracy that every political party , whether we belong to it , should vote , " he said .
most voters , whatever their political inclinations , said the most important thing was to restore Ivory Coast to civilian rule .
the junta supervised a referendum in July , and voters were eager to take a new step in the excessive process of restoring a legitimate form of government , with citizens overwhelmingly in favour of the new constitution .

sources recently revealed that Lenovo may have trouble completing its acquisition of IBMPC , as the U.S. government departments concerned began to worry that the deal would threaten U.S. national security .
in December , Lenovo announced it would buy IBM PC for $ 1.75 billion , including $ 650 million in cash , $ 600 million in stock and $ 500 million in debt .
... IBM Disclosure of Long-term Losses in the PC Industry Lenovo Integration Road is not smooth. http : / / davyzw.blogchina.com / blog / article _ 106008.579602 . HTML IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said : " IBM has submitted an application to the Foreign Investment Commission , in which the Commission has addressed us . when reviewing transactions with Lenovo , we are willing to cooperate with each other . "
Lenovo spokeswoman Alice Li said : " Lenovo is willing to cooperate fully with the relevant U. S. departments to investigate . "
so far , the Chinese government has not commented on this .
the main function of the Foreign Investment Commission of the United States is to review the acquisitions of American companies by international companies , which have previously vetoed acquisitions by Chinese-related companies in the United States .
in 2003 , Hong Kong and Huang were forced to abandon their acquisition of Global Telecommunications because of opposition from the U.S. Defense Department and other members of the Foreign Investment Commission .
the U.S. Defense Department at the time believed that the acquisition of Global Telecommunications by Hehuang could pose a threat to U.S. national security .

sources said Lenovo and IBM filed an application with the Foreign Investment Commission on December 29 , 2004 .
under U.S. law , if a Foreign Investment Commission fails to approve a foreign acquisition request within 30 days , the commission must conduct a formal investigation of the transaction and submit the findings to the President of the United States for final decision .
Tony Fratto , a Treasury spokesman , said : " for national security reasons , we will not comment on transactions that might be reviewed by the Foreign Investment Commission . "
foreign investment committees never disclose to the public whether a transaction is being reviewed or what decisions they will make .
James Bodner , senior vice president of Cohen Group , a U.S. consultancy , says most deals are usually quickly approved by the Foreign Investment Commission .
" very few transactions under review by foreign investment memberships go into the investigation phase , but once they go into the review phase , 50 % of the transactions will be rejected or cancelled , " he said .
in negotiations with the Foreign Investment Commission , IBM has proposed some measures to address national security concerns at the North Carolina plant , sources said .

the recent rise in oil prices has tightened everyone 's nerves .
compared with last year 's lowest price , current oil prices have increased nearly three times .
on the New York Mercantile Exchange , for example , the November futures price of light crude oil reached $ 31.86 a barrel , up $ 1 from the previous trading day .
on the 10th , the price rose another $ 1.32 to $ 33.18 a barrel , or $ 2.32 in two days .
Brent North Sea crude oil futures also rose $ 1.09 to $ 31.85 a barrel on the London futures market Monday .
by the end of last week , when the situation in the Middle East was tense , oil prices had risen to more than $ 35 .
people began to ask themselves : will such a rise in oil prices cause the great depression ?
will the oil crisis return in 1973 ?
the rise in oil prices has affected politics .
in Europe , excitement and unrest arise .
in the United States , one of the important topics of the presidential election is oil price .
in late September , the U.S. government urgently decided to put 30 million barrels of strategic reserve crude oil into the market to lower oil prices .
the rise in oil prices , of course , will also affect the recovery of Asian economies .
it is well known that the 1973 Arab oil embargo led to a decade-long " stagflation " of the global economy , in which stagnation and inflation coincided .
in the early 1980s , the U.S. economy was mired in double-digit unemployment , double-digit inflation and high double-digit interest rates , Europe was worse off , and Japan was badly hit .
but a careful analysis of the situation reveals that rising oil prices are not the only cause of the economic crisis .
the real reason lies in a series of deep-seated structural and cyclical issues .
the post-war population explosion led to a boom in consumption and a drop in savings , putting enormous pressure on commodity and financial markets .
economic cycle effect is also the main reason , because by the 1970s , economic growth began in the early 1950s has been weak .
under the influence of both structural and cyclical factors , the economic crisis finally broke out and social and political contradictions were extremely acute .
the rise in oil prices has only exacerbated the economic crisis caused by cyclical and structural problems .
today we are also facing structural and cyclical problems , and rising oil prices are only part of the problem .
population problems that once caused stagflation have evolved into a driving force for capital formation , especially in the United States .
baby boomers are in a period of low consumption and high savings , supporting capital markets .
but in the long run , the outlook is not optimistic , as baby boomers face retirement in as many as 10 years and a lot of money will be pumped out of the market .
in addition , in the global economy , other countries outside the United States have not enjoyed American-style economic growth , Asia is still not fully out of the crisis , the development of Europe is not balanced , Russia is in a deep recession .
the stock market cycle is also very serious , people are asking : " when will the bull market end " ?
the bull market actually ended several months ago .
to a certain extent , we are undergoing a large-scale recession .
look at the economic barometer of the stock market : in the United States , the Standard & Poor 's , Dow Jones and Automated Quotation Index are all in crisis and fell to new lows last week .
in addition , stocks in Japan , Hong Kong , Singapore , the United Kingdom , Germany and France also fell sharply .
obviously , in a sense , the global market has begun to enter a cyclical recession .
the uneven development of the world economic structure is also continuing .
Moreover , many problems in the operation of the U. S. economy are gradually exposed , some experts believe that the U. S. economy will enter a period of recession or slow down .
Europe and Japan are also troubled by problems .
Russia is full of variables and deep troubles .
for the Asian region , some experts believe that the financial crisis left a huge amount of bad debt and corporate debt problems are far from being resolved , the current bad debt rate is still as high as 10 % - 40 % .
many of the companies that survived the financial crisis were heavily indebted , unable to repay their debts and lacking productive capital .
because of the prudence of bank lending , many enterprises raise funds by listing and issuing bonds . many enterprises regard debt-to-equity swap as an important means of restructuring and repaying debts .
however , this year , due to its own political and economic problems and the United States financial market volatility and international oil price rise and other adverse factors , financial markets in some Asian countries and regions have repeatedly experienced major fluctuations , some people worry that the Asian financial crisis may recur .
only by removing all kinds of interference factors , insisting on deepening economic and financial reform , intensifying the adjustment of enterprises , speeding up the adjustment of export product structure , and striving to find new economic growth points , can Asia 's economy get out of the shadow and develop healthily as soon as possible .

Mr. Donis said : they injected a lot of effort into the demonstration and protest .
however , they have only one way to go : to bring the WTO into litigation , which they now see as effective .
he was personally delighted , and he was confident that ranchers would be delighted with the decision .
he also appealed to the Australian and New Zealand governments to claim compensation from the United States . he said : it is clear that the initiative is back in the hands of Australia and New Zealand , so Canberra and Wellington must ask Washington for economic claims .
at the same time , they want to see tariffs and quotas cancelled and markets take over .
according to a preliminary survey conducted by New Zealand , the compensation could amount to as much as $ 8 million .
Australia 's trade minister , Markwell , said it was too early to talk about compensation , although the United States was unlikely to continue appealing and succeed .
he said : the WTO has not fully published the full text of the ruling , and he can not comment on this matter .
he said : only after seeing the text of the ruling will the government be able to take up the issue .

before the caps and tariffs in Washington , demand for mutton in the U.S. market grew , while the U.S. mutton industry was on the decline .

the crisis committee includes military , police , supplies , economy and other important departments .
the new Yugoslavia Congress may meet at 6 .
Milosevic 's fate is apparently in the hands of the Yugoslav military leadership , the main forces that supported him during his administration , which met in Belgrade on the morning of the 6th , according to the state-run Tangar News Agency .
Russian President Vladimir Putin also sent Foreign Minister Ivanov to Yugoslavia on the morning of the 6th , hoping to help resolve the political crisis in Yugoslavia .

Milosevic lost 40.23 % to 18-party opposition coalition candidate Kostunica in the first round of the Yugoslav presidential election on September 24 , according to official results .
although Milosevic demanded a second round of voting on October 8 , opposition parties said they had won the election and refused to accept the request to vote again .
as for the latest developments on the 5th , Kostunica , who spoke on television , has been called President-elect by Yugoslav media .
Kostunica , 56 , had previously said that defeating Milosevic in the election was tantamount to defeating the world 's last dictator and would end Yugoslavia 's 10-plus-year-old recession .
Kostunica 's low-key style , unlike Yugoslavia 's historic presidential candidates , has not been achieved as a fairly charismatic icon .
on the contrary , Kostunica has affinity and integrity , not only for the bloody and war-torn civilian population has a calming charm , but also allows the Yugoslav people to have confidence in the future without Milosevic , igniting hope .
Kostunica used to pursue academia until 1974 when he was dismissed from Belgrade Law School for reactionary reasons and forced to leave the academic circle .
Kostunica joined the opposition movement in the early 1990s and then established the Serbian Democratic Party in 1992 .

Milosevic 's subsequent influence in the party can be said to be on the rise , experienced many important business positions , including Baogua as the chief state-owned bank president .
until 1987 Milosevic took advantage of an opponent of the Communist Party leader , Stanley Shi Tanli , to use his political power to expand his influence .
after a month , Shi tanli was kidnapped and his whereabouts remained unknown .
while the Yugoslav Federation was gradually disintegrating , Milosevic used Serbian democratic sentiment and was elected Serbian President in 1989 .
the Serbian supremacy advocated by him also led to a series of wars in Croatia , Slovenia , Bosnia and Kosovo , and the people 's livelihood was chaotic .
according to the latest reports , the opposition has pointed out that Milosevic is now hiding in the southeastern border of Serbia , and is likely to make a struggle to launch the last wave of counterattack .
these are the reports that Wu Mingkang compiled for you .

as for George W. Bush , he invited former State Secretary Baker to monitor the recount on their behalf , and was confident of the results .
U.S. President Bill Clinton used this election to show that the strength of the electorate can not be ignored .
as for the ballot papers , all 67 counties in Florida have counted 10 counties , 109 more for Gore and 92 more for Bush .
the counting exercise had been suspended until late at night .
ticket checks will be completed at 7 : 00 a.m. Taipei time tomorrow , but there are still many overseas correspondence votes that have not yet been delivered . the governor of Florida has also made it clear that slow words may drag on for about 10 days .

a highly educated couple friend of mine , who came to Singapore many years ago , soon became a local citizen at the urging of the government .
their only son , Yang Yang , has been studying and living in Singapore since the second grade of primary school .
a few days ago , I learned from a telephone conversation with Yang Yang 's mother that Yang Yang had become a very tiresome , unintentional child , and his grades had plummeted .
when his mother felt very sorry for him , he was helpless .
" Yang Yang is not a very sensible , very polite , always in the forefront of the academic performance of a good child ? "
I remember everything about Yang 4 years ago , so I asked .
" oh , it 's all bad for us to be parents .
we are always busy with our work , and when a child has a problem , we lack patience and guidance , and couples often disagree with each other in educating him .
from this , I believe that the bad children are all the responsibilities of their parents .
really , it must be the responsibility of parents . "
when I hung up the phone , I couldn 't help feeling deeply moved .
when we become teachers , can we meet several parents who are so self reproach and self-cultivation in their whole life ?
when I was depressed about my incompetence before a bad student , I often contacted my parents .
most parents blame school education and the influence of bad friends . no one in their memory holds the responsibility on themselves .
education has long told us that parents are the first teachers of their children .
I believe in this .
the courage to take responsibility is an urgent lesson for local parents , and not long ago after the SQ 006 crash , Singapore Airlines posture and strong sense of responsibility , should be said to be a profound lesson for the local people .
although the newspapers were still discussing whether there was any dereliction of duty in Taiwan 's ground work , the Singapore Airlines bosses knew that no amount of misleading would turn the left into the right , so they immediately issued a statement of full responsibility .
I think if everyone around us had the courage of my friends and my wife and the wisdom of Singapore Airlines , maybe Singapore would not have so many complaints .
( Toronto Associated Press ) Canadian police arrested two masterminds on Friday for plotting to blow up an Indian Airlines airliner after 15 years of trying to investigate thousands of people in secret .
two Sikh men were arrested on charges of planting bombs to blow up an Air India airliner flying over Ireland in 1985 , killing 329 people and two baggage handlers in Tokyo .
these accusations make the case the largest group murder in Canada .
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it was one of the largest and most intricate investigations ever conducted by the Canadian police .
air India Flight 182 exploded on June 23 , 1985 and crashed off the Irish coast , killing all 329 people on board .
flight 182 took off from Montreal to New Delhi and was originally scheduled to stop over in London .
on the same day , in Tokyo , a bomb buried in the luggage that was supposed to be sent to another printed flight exploded , killing two baggage handlers on the spot .
Canadian investigators had long suspected that the bomb was planted by Sikh militants in retaliation for the Indian army 's 1984 raid on the Golden Temple in Amritsar , the Hindu Sikh shrine .
a Sikh man has been in jail in Canada for 10 years because of the bombing in Tokyo .
police say two men arrested on Friday , Malik ( 53 ) and Bagli ( 51 ) .
they were all charged with deliberate murder , conspiracy , attempted murder , conspiracy to conceal a bomb on an aircraft and to place a bomb on an aircraft .
the charges allege that they planned and executed two bombings that killed 331 people - 329 on Flight 182 plus two baggage handlers .
they are also accused of trying to kill all the people on the two flights .
police Assistant Captain Bisson said investigators said the bombs were either from Vancouver or were hidden there , plotting in Canadian Columbia .
Malik started a large holding company in Vancouver from India to Canada in 1972 and ran a credit union and a school .
there were many changes in the presidential recall case yesterday . in addition to President Chen 's remarks , Chen Sheng also issued a statement : strictly criticizing the opposition party for launching a recall is a power struggle .
President of the ruling party , Xie Changting , also held a press conference , calling on the opposition parties to take the overall situation of the country as the most important , to cancel the recall case .
but opposition parties have stressed that the recall is a balancing mechanism in democratic politics , and what to do next remains to be discussed .
in an 8,000-word statement , Chen hoped that the opposition parties would immediately stop their irrational protests .
Chen Sheng believes that opposition parties disagree with the policy of the Executive Yuan and that President Chen 's actions will not be recalled .
" the recall case is a heavy price , so you can imagine it is foreseeable , can Taiwan afford it ?
can Taiwan stand such a concussion ?
Xie Changting , chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) , also expressed his view after his afternoon talks with President Chen Shui-bian that the opposition party 's resolute recall may have negative effects on people 's livelihood and society .
" Anti-nuclear , pro-nuclear , as I publicize it , there will be a lot of social unrest , impact , are recall cases must be endless . "
so far , however , Chen Sheng and the ruling party 's appeals do not seem to have dispelled the opposition .
" whether or not we want to bring a recall case , whether we want to bring a no-confidence case , and what laws the court is going to bring , and even whether or not we want to bring an impeachment case , may be the whole discussion here . "
the DPP says it will make every effort and way to coordinate with the opposition parties in the future .
Chen Shui-bian 's sincere talks can make the recall case change , the ruling Democratic Progressive Party is also waiting .
( Florida , France ) The Florida Supreme Court rejected Gore 's two appeals the day before yesterday , refused to allow Gore to immediately recalculate Florida 's disputed ballots , nor allow Palm Beach County to vote again .
but Gore has three more crucial indictments that have been allowed to sit in three Florida courts .
the decision of the Florida Supreme Court the day before yesterday was only a slight blow to Gore , because he still had three tricks to play , namely , three lawsuits that had been allowed to go to trial , and if he succeeded , Gore might be defeated and elected to the White House .
one of the main charges was launched yesterday and is scheduled to be heard in the Lyon County Circuit Court .
the lawsuit calls for a recount of 462,000 ballots in Palm Beach and 654,000 in Miami-Dade County .
the Gore camp feared that the counties would not be able to recount their votes before the December 12 deadline when they had to submit a list of state electoral corps , so the appeal state Supreme Court ordered an immediate recount , but the Florida Supreme Court has rejected its request .
but the Supreme Court judge did not rule that the counties could not recount their votes manually until he had indicated that he would listen to Bush 's plea .
so Gore is still likely to win the Lyon County Circuit Court and recalculate the two counties .
Gore 's camp estimates that Bush would lose if 3,300 Palm Beach County votes and 10,000 Miami-Dade votes were recalculated artificially .
electoral nominations will be decided on the 12th if the recount is not completed , but it is still difficult to predict whether the recount will be completed before the Electoral Nomination Day on December 12 after the judgment of the court .
if the recount fails , the Florida state legislature will decide the nomination according to the Constitution , and the Florida state legislature is currently controlled by the Republicans , so Bush will eventually win 25 electoral votes in Florida .
the day before yesterday , a judge promised to hear a lawsuit against the invalidation of Martin County 's overseas ballots on December 6 .
earlier , the case concerning the abolition of overseas ballots in Seminole County was allowed to be heard in another court on the same day , with a hearing time difference of only 90 minutes between the two cases .
both indictments were filed by the Democrats , mainly referring to election officials in the counties who illegally and unfairly assisted the Bush camp in calculating overseas ballots , and demanded that the counties 'overseas ballots be scrapped .
George W. Bush won 537 votes in the latest tally , and if Gore wins either of the two suits , he could win Florida , winning 25 electoral votes for the next president .

the two governments issued a joint statement on the same day , announcing the cessation of mutual hostility and striving to establish a new type of relations .
nearly half a century after the end of the Korean War , the United States and the DPRK are finally ready to abandon their former suspects and end their hostilities , taking an important step on the road to normalization of bilateral relations .
Zhao Ming-lu paid a visit to the United States in the context of the gradual improvement of US-DPRK relations and the easing of the situation on the Korean Peninsula .
since Perry , the former US Defense Secretary , visited the DPRK last May , the two sides have begun negotiations on outstanding issues in bilateral relations and made progress .
in June this year , the North and South of the Korean Peninsula held a historic summit , the DPRK-ROK relations improved rapidly , and the situation on the Korean Peninsula eased significantly .
during this period , the U.S. government gradually partially lifted the nearly 50-year-old economic sanctions against North Korea . U.S. Secretary of State Albright and North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Nam Shun also made their first contacts during the 7th ASEAN Regional Forum meeting in Bangkok in July .
Zhao Minglu 's visit to the United States as a special envoy of Kim Jong-il is of great significance .
this is a sign that the United States and the DPRK have turned from confrontation to relaxation and an important step towards normalization of their relations .
after arriving in Washington on the 9th , Zhao Ming-lu made a written statement saying that he hoped to use his visit to the United States as an opportunity to repair DPRK-US relations .
he said that he would do his utmost to engage in frank dialogue with American leaders in order to eliminate the long-standing deep-rooted mistrust between the United States and the DPRK , and to push the bilateral relations to a new stage , bringing about " epoch-making changes " .
during his visit , Zhao Minglu transmitted a personal letter from Kim Jong Il to President Clinton , and conveyed the views of North Korean leaders on further improving bilateral relations .
in the joint statement , the United States and the DPRK pledged to take steps to " fundamentally " improve bilateral relations , believing that this is not only in the interests of the two peoples in the 21st century , but also conducive to ensuring security and peace on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region .
as the first important step in advancing bilateral relations along the " new direction " , the two sides pledged to stop hostility towards each other and to do their utmost to establish a " new relationship free from past hostilities " in the future .
the two sides are also prepared to further ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula through the " Quartet Talks " and other means , replacing the armistice agreement signed in 1953 with a peace agreement .
at the same time , the two sides will continue to strive to eliminate mutual distrust and maintain a constructive atmosphere of dialogue .
of course , there are still many obstacles to resolve the long-standing differences between the United States and the DPRK , and it will take time for the two countries to fully normalize their relations .
however , the understanding reached through Zhao Minglu 's visit to the United States has laid a foundation for further improving bilateral relations .
Albright will travel to Pyongyang at the end of this month to prepare for Clinton 's visit , indicating that US-DPRK relations are continuing to move towards full normalization of bilateral relations .

people who have cars are not comfortable . they spent NT , 000 yuan to buy a car . although they have contributed to the automobile industry , they also pay taxes for the government . they can drive everywhere , almost like climbing .
despite the many yellow and white roads painted on the road and the numerous traffic lights set up overhead , the way to go is still the way to go , so is the car , and so is the person .
it is difficult to move to the destination , parking has become a problem , parking at the door of people , not ; find a parking lot , hard to stop , around , it is better to walk .
scolding or scolding the police , how to manage it ?
when driving the most afraid of suddenly crossing the road pedestrians , some people do not walk on the sidewalk at all , regardless of traffic lights , a pair of eyes without car posture .
I myself had been frightened by a sudden pedestrian who stopped and my heart pounded , and the man still looked as if nothing had happened , angry and cursing .
I used to drive to the quarry in Ma 'anshan , parked in the parking lot , and came out without checking .

my friend bought a car , but seldom used it . ask the reason why , just a few minutes riding a bicycle to work , driving often more than a few minutes , plus in the basement to see the tense parking space , I was afraid of crashing the car , home or parking difficulties , so simply not .
just travel on weekends or long holidays .
on May 1st this year , the new road traffic law came into effect , much stricter than before , so the most feared drivers were the police , and the ubiquitous cameras , which were blown out without notice .
the problem is not here . if the police are caught by the police , it will be all right .
Unfortunately , you often do not know when and where you have committed a " case " , and when you have the annual car inspection , the police showed a photograph of violations , the evidence is conclusive , can not rely on it , obediently accept multiple treatment .

members of the Xiamen Municipal Consultative Conference and relevant experts have recently proposed to set up a cross-strait CEPA pilot area in Xiamen , to test relevant measures within the area in accordance with the CEPA mechanism of Hong Kong and Macao , and finally to form a cross-strait free trade zone including other parts of the mainland and Taiwan Island .
relevant Topics : Hong Kong and the Mainland Signed CEPA Export Shrinkage Has Recovered * Regional Port Linkage to Expand Direct Shipping Effect At present , there are eight pilot projects of regional port linkage in the Mainland , including Xiamen , mainly for the purpose of integrating port location advantages with the functional advantages of bonded zones and realizing the goal of realizing the linkage . regional linkage , functional linkage and information linkage between port and bonded area .
in a sense , the pilot project of " regional-port linkage " will become a free trade area cultivated by the mainland in the future .
the report of Xiamen Citizens 'Entry holds that while the free trade port area has been established in Kaohsiung Harbor , Xiamen has also activated the " regional port linkage " project , which will bring more opportunities for cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , expand and strengthen the effect of the pilot direct flights between Xiamen and Kaohsiung , and may also contend with each other . take the opportunity to take the lead in realizing direct flights with Kaohsiung and substantially promote the direct " three links " between the two sides .
according to the statistics of Xiamen Port , Xiamen and Kaohsiung have been experimenting with direct flights for seven years . the traffic volume has been increasing continuously . so far , the total transport volume has exceeded 2.65 million TEUs .
for the first time in 2004 , the volume of direct shipping containers exceeded 350,000 TEUs . in the first month of this year , the volume increased by 25.32 % to 37,754 TEUs compared with the same period last year .
Xiamen Kaohsiung Cooperation Advantages Complementary Xiamen Progressive Experts said that Kaohsiung Port from the legislation to the implementation of the specific precedent in Xiamen , Xiamen Port provides a good template and catch-up goals .
at present , Xiamen 's wages and land prices are lower than the Kaohsiung port , which is very attractive for the source of goods in Kaohsiung port .
Xiamen can not only strive for transshipment goods in Southeast Asia and other places , but also make preferential rates to encourage containers originally transshipped through Kaohsiung Port to go directly to trunk lines , and attract Taiwan 's goods to Xiamen for transshipment , so as to realize " transporting empty containers and high containers from Xiamen Port to Kaohsiung Port " Xiong Kong 's heavy luggage to Xiamen transit .
in addition , according to the Taiwan policy of " equal priority and appropriate relaxation " , Xiamen can relax the tax and fee standards for enterprises when attracting Taiwanese investment in port infrastructure construction , and introduce Taiwan 's ocean shipping , logistics and warehousing industries into Xiamen Port Area to attract Taiwanese investment to establish a link in Xiamen . at the same time , it has expanded the direct service between Xiamen and Taiwan , and promoted the development of the " regional port linkage " zone .
according to Wang Yongjun , the director of Xiamen Port Authority , Xiamen has started to speed up the construction of the pilot project of " regional port linkage " . the biggest move is to integrate the seven major ports around Xiamen Bay in Xiamen and Zhangzhou , and to manage them in a unified way . within five to six years , more than 10 billion yuan will be invested to build it into an international transit port of tens of millions of standard boxes , bringing the cargo handling capacity of Xiamen Port to 26-290 million tons in 2010 , and the container handling capacity of 17-19 million standard boxes , a total of 114 deep waters . Wharf berth is better than super Kaohsiung international transfer port .
experts said that the implementation of the CEPA agreement between the mainland and Taiwan is operable , Xiamen to the " free trade port " transformation , will eventually be very likely to achieve " cross-strait free trade area " .

since the junior year of middle school , Lin Lifan ( 16 years old ) has found his own day in a slowing pace since he was transferred from shortcuts to regular courses .

under the supervision of teachers and parents , Lin began to rediscover his enthusiasm for learning .
his efforts are also directly reflected in the increasingly excellent transcripts .
his father , Lin Wencai ( 49 , a businessman ) , said his first reaction when he learned that he had been transferred to a regular source course was neither to fight nor to scold , but to speak to him with a long focus .
this not only inspires him to be determined to study hard , but also keeps him in mind .
he said , " My father told me that it 's okay to read a book badly and never lose faith in myself . if I work hard , I will succeed in the end . "
Lin Lifan , who was always not good at expressing himself , did not respond at that time , but his father 's words clearly left a deep impression in his heart .
since then , he has decided to prove that he has lived up to the expectations of his parents and teachers by taking practical actions .
Lin 's mother , Zheng Fuzhi ( 48 ) , said she was often " called " by the school 's teachers and principals from his fourth to second grade , because Lin often did not hand in or lost her homework .
she said that the teachers could see that he was a gifted and intelligent child , but somehow he just couldn 't concentrate on his studies and didn 't like being ordered to do things . his grades were good and bad , so it was even more painful .
she said : " since he moved into the general stream , perhaps the teacher 's teaching methods are different , arousing his interest in learning , he is also more willing to tell us what happened in the school .
we are most gratified that this child , who once worried us most , finally found confidence and faced his future .

a ministry official confirmed the talks , but declined to say how far they were going .
the two companies will be exploiting an area of the high seas in northern Taiwan , which Tokyo and Beijing both claim to be their exclusive economic waters .
contradictions between the two countries on this issue of waters are increasing , and warships of the two countries frequently patrol the waters .
last summer , Chinese ships even surrounded a Norwegian investigative ship hired by Japan to stop it from entering the waters .
the decision to allow drilling would unusually show Tokyo 's political determination to avoid confrontation with Beijing for a long time , fearing it would evoke memories of Japan 's brutal invasion of China in the 1930s .
but Tokyo 's fear of China 's growing economic and diplomatic status in the region has forced it to abandon decades of moderate foreign policy and instead compete head-to-head with its rising rival .
last November , Japanese warships made the boldest move since World War II to expel a Chinese nuclear submarine from Japanese waters .
even after last month 's tsunami disaster in Southeast Asian countries , Japan has struggled to outstrip China-Japan by $ 500 million in humanitarian aid , compared with China 's $ 83 million . Japan will also help build a tsunami warning system in the region .
the East China Sea dispute began in June last year when China suddenly began building offshore drilling platforms on the fringes of the disputed areas .
although the drilling equipment is located in China 's agreed waters , Japan says it is too close to disputed waters to seize Japanese gas .
in October last year , the two sides held emergency talks in Beijing , and Japanese diplomats asked China to hand over research data on the size of Chunxiao gas field reserves to Japan .
China did not pay attention to this request .

another radical Muslim Jihad also called on supporters to continue a month-long " uprising " .
in the Casa Strip , a group of Palestinian police stopped Palestinian demonstrators clashing with Israeli soldiers yesterday and physically blocked and expelled young demonstrators in the frictional zone .

Xinhua News Agency , Shanghai , Oct. 9 ( Reporter Chen Maodi Pan Qing ) The Shanghai Second Intermediate People 's Court today made a judgment on a special case of unfair competition : the defendant , Shanghai Chenrong Intelligent Technology Development Co . , Ltd . , registered the " Safeguard " domain name . .com.cn ) invalid , should be immediately stopped using and revoked .
plaintiff , P & G company ( P & G ) is a world famous daily chemical enterprise .
in May 1976 , Procter & Gamble applied for registration of the " safeguard " trademark in China and renewed it until May 2006 .
in June 1994 , the company applied to the State Administration of Industry and Commerce for the registration of the trademark Safeguard Shufujia , which was valid from June 1994 to June 2004 .
P & G has registered the " safeguard " trademark in the United States , Germany , Japan , France and Australia since 1962 .
in 1984 and 1994 , P & G licensed its registered trademarks to be used in daily cleaning products such as soap and shower gel by Guangzhou P & G and Tianjin P & G , which were invested and established in China .
in January 1999 , the defendant Chen-hyun Company 's predecessor , Shanghai Chen-hyun Science and Trade Co . , Ltd . , applied to the China Internet Network Information Center for registration of the " safeguard.com.cn " domain name .
the plaintiff P & G believes that the registration of the " safeguard.com.cn " registered trademark in its domain name by Morning Hyun Company is obviously a malicious registration and " free-rider " act of unfair competition , which can easily mislead the online public into mistaking Morning Hyun Company and P & G. The department and its " safeguard " trademark are related to each other , which damages its legitimate interests , so it goes to court .
after trial , the Shanghai Second Intermediate People 's Court held that the registrants in the category domain name " .com " are commercial organizations . if the three or two-level domain names registered in front of the category domain name " .com " enjoy a high reputation in the market with others and are relevant to the public . it is well known that the same registered trademark will cause commercial confusion and damage the interests of the registered trademark holders .
this kind of behavior violates the legal spirit of China 's Trademark Law and Anti-Unfair Competition Law .
the court held that P & G paid a huge advertising fee for the trademark " safeguard " and had a higher recognition rate among consumers .
at the same time , this registered trademark has been listed as a key protection trademark by the State Administration for Industry and commerce .
Chenhyun 's registration in this case prevented P & G from registering the " safeguard " registered trademark as a third-class domain name in " .com " , thus constituting unfair competition for malicious registration .

Jiang Xianbing thinks that the website company is to continue the business mechanism , so there will be many companies will have mergers and acquisitions .
" that 's a special part of big Chinese companies , most of them pack companies , it 's not a publicly listed company , so it will continue its business mechanism through mergers and acquisitions .
I think we 'll see a lot of mergers and acquisitions in the future , or acquisitions , or shipping , and eventually a few groups .
Jiang Xianbing said that companies ranked second or third in the mainland and Taiwan 's Internet market are now feeling the pressure , so website companies will think about similar mergers and acquisitions .
he was not surprised at this phenomenon .
in addition , Huang Ming , chairman of the Information Industry Promotion Association , a consortium , also expressed his opinion that Taiwan 's market is too small . apart from the fact that the Internet economy is still large , competition in the international market will be an irresistible trend .

the lorries were parked in the parking lot of East Coast Park .
the deceased , Yao Ruichun , 37 , unmarried , businessman , lived in the 620 Block House on Bailuo Shuichi Road , operating car batteries .
he was found breathless in a yellow van in the D1 parking lot of East Coast Park with a plastic bag over his head early yesterday morning .
after receiving the report at 8 : 40 a.m. yesterday , the police went to the scene to investigate and notify his family .
later , his family went to the scene to confirm his identity .
according to witnesses , the deceased was found sitting side by side in the driver 's seat of the truck , head covered with airtight black garbage bags .
the window of the truck is closed but the door is unlocked .
when the reporter went to the scene to interview , the police were dealing with the bodies of the deceased and objects inside the vehicle .
it was observed that the deceased was of medium height , dark skin , short hair , blue short-sleeved sweater , dark shorts and barefoot .

the passenger seat next to the driver had some blood stains and a pair of glasses believed to have been left by the deceased .
in addition , beside the van of the deceased , a small white bus registered in Malaysia was parked side by side .
Judging from the accumulation of fallen leaves on the bus sweepers and roofs , the car has been parked there for several days .
the police have classified the case as an unnatural death and have appealed to those in the know to contact the Buluo police station at 2440 000 .
South Asia relief , a call for " people-oriented " voice of the century 's first largest natural disaster , in a festival to 150,000 innocent deaths and millions of victims .
more than 10 days passed , and the whole world was sober from shock .
through newspaper layout and TV screen , I saw countless hands reaching out .
the amount of donations from various countries has increased linearly , and it is said to have exceeded five billion dollars .
rescuers sent a bag of food and a bag of clothes to the victims .
these words and pictures express a very clear message : human life is above all the value .
it is important to save people , and the interests of the rest of the great powers , ideology , racial disputes , personal grievances , are trivial matters .
a phenomenon that may be overlooked : the first number highlighted in disaster reports in the world 's major media is the death toll .
from the initial 30,000 people , after continuous pursuit of the report , has been added to the recent more than 150,000 people .
it 's not that people don 't mind the loss of property , but property is more important than people .
no one , what is the significance of Jinshan Yinshan ?
the value of putting people first in all objective values is not always shared in China from ancient times to present .
sometimes a little bit of life is reflected in : my elementary school classmate , with his father 's new bicycle to learn to ride for the first time , fell and scratched his leg and bicycle .
her father had been in pain for a long time , not her daughter 's legs but her bicycle .
her dad said that a scratched leg would grow well , and a bicycle would never grow well .
the idea of a classmate 's father was widely accepted by the society at that time .
two years ago , China 's new leaders began to put forward the idea of " putting people first " .
more and more Chinese intellectual elites are beginning to realize that " people-oriented " means respecting , caring , understanding and caring for people everywhere , and thinking from a convenient , considerate and suitable perspective .
many scholars have demonstrated " people-oriented " from the perspective of education , economy and environmental protection .
for example , some people argue that " people-oriented " as a value orientation , its fundamental is to respect people , people-oriented , people first .
when " people-oriented " is regarded as the value choice of education , education has the significance of creating human value .
it has also been argued that , in terms of the characteristics of the use of resources , material is limited and exclusive , some people occupy more , others less ; and knowledge is shared , the more people used , the greater the utility .
in addition , an economic order based on people-oriented motivation is more likely to enjoy lasting prosperity than one guided by short-term behavior .
at the same time of these extremely valuable thoughts , there are some transcendental thoughts .
" in China , the individual 's spirit of freedom remains trapped in group consciousness , or in the collective unconsciousness of authority , " wrote one online author .
" the modern Chinese who pursue civilization do not know whether the people-oriented advocated at present is only a part of people-oriented , or good people-oriented , or bad people-oriented , or should be based on the spirit of human freedom and individual consciousness . "
disaster relief in South Asia , a global wide-ranging action in 2005 , provides a good opportunity to call for a new " people-oriented " approach .
China 's Central Television ( CCTV ) has made an unusual move to mobilize donations from men , women , old and young people across the country on a long and repetitive broadcast frequency band .
in some places , the Party and government departments have made donations to the victims of the disaster in South Asia a political task at the grass-roots level .
since there is such a large-scale relief propaganda momentum , as long as a little bit of " people-oriented " content , it will become an excellent " human enlightenment " .
in this enlightenment , China 's new generation of leaders " people-oriented " concept , through a strong propaganda network to penetrate the hearts of the people .
a little bit of advice is that the article is thoughtful but the text is too small for me to look at with a magnifying glass : PLSENLARGE THE SIZE OF WORDS

Vice President Lv and the New News lawsuit became more and more complicated after the plaintiff jumped out and said she was the source .
the Vice President 's office is holding a press conference , and we 'll have the latest report later .
but first of all , we are concerned about the latest developments in the work-hour case , including the fact that labor groups that support and oppose shortening work-hours gather outside the Legislative Council in the morning to express their positions .
Taipei police warned for the three time .

they hope to postpone the implementation of shorter working hours , so that factory closures will not allow everyone to lose their jobs .
workers confronted the police across the street , and the deafening sound from the loudspeakers forced the police to raise a sign to warn them of the gathering without prior application .
" the second lifting , immediately dissolve , please immediately stop the illegal act and dissolve . "
but the warning came to the warning that the labor groups and the police still played with each other .
Legislative committees on the command car continued to get on the bus to support the police , and the police also took advantage of the gap to strengthen the deployment of the redevelopment team .

workers opposed to working hours on this side thought their position had been fully expressed after three warnings raised by the police and eventually dispersed .

Mr. Dai Yi , a famous scholar , said , " Foreign missionaries came to China in large numbers during the Opium War , and their foreign aggression and missionary cause were closely linked from the beginning .
missionaries were part of the aggression , and the invading army paved the way for the activities of the missionaries , who were the forerunners and supplies of the foreign aggressive forces at that time .
scholars also talked about the historical background and causes of hundreds of religious cases in modern Chinese history .
they pointed out that the missionary case was triggered by the evils of some missionaries , by the people 's spontaneous anti-imperialist patriotic actions , and eventually led to the " Boxer Movement " which shocked the Chinese and foreign countries .
western missionaries have committed heinous crimes against the Chinese people and have aroused strong condemnation from all peace-loving and just people in the world .
scholars also pointed out that missionaries such as Ma Lai , Guo Xize and Liu Fangji , who were killed in previous religious cases , were full of evil and spotted with evil deeds , and were still rejected by the local Chinese people .
in spite of the strong opposition of the Chinese people , the Holy See made these missionaries saints , which fully exposed their attempts to use religion for political purposes and their consistent anti-Communist and anti-Chinese stance . it was a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the Chinese Church by openly interfering in China 's internal affairs and a 1.2 billion Chinese people . the serious provocation of the people .
scholars strongly protested the Vatican 's retrogression . professor Zheng Siqu of Beijing Normal University said : " today 's China is not a century ago , and the Chinese nation is rapidly moving towards a revival .
under such circumstances , the Vatican would not have had a good result in summoning missionaries against the Chinese people .

internationally , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak , speaking to the nation on the evening of the 9th , announced that he would present his resignation to Israeli President Katsav on the 10th and organize a new prime minister election within 60 days in accordance with the relevant legal provisions .
the current Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have long been deadlocked , and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is intensifying . the government of Barak is facing the most serious political crisis since 18 months in power , known for its brilliance and vigor , when Barak unexpectedly resigned from the real cause Why ?
let 's look at our analysis report .
according to the analysis , the main reasons for Barak 's resignation are as follows : first , Barak tried to avoid the former Prime Minister 's opposition Likud Group Chairman Netanyahu 's comeback through the Prime Minister 's election .
opinion polls show that Sharon , Likud 's current chairman , has a lower approval rating than Barak 's , but Netanyahu 's approval rating is 19 percentage points higher than Barak 's , and Netanyahu resigned after last year 's election defeat .
according to the electoral law , only members of Parliament are eligible to run for prime minister , Barak announced his resignation , the reopening of the prime minister election can eliminate the hidden danger of Netanyahu .
second , in order to avoid holding new parliamentary elections , Barak took office in July last year , focused on promoting the Middle East peace process , ignoring the implementation of domestic economic and social reform plans , leading to a strong community . strong discontent , coupled with the excessive use of force in dealing with the conflict between Israel and Palestine for more than two months and the displeasure of Left-wing groups and Israeli Arabs , led the Labour Party to win elections with the support of Israeli Arab voters , as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict intensified . Israel 's Arabs say they are no longer in favor of Barak . if parliament is dissolved and general elections are held , the prime minister and parliamentary elections will be held at the same time . Barak is worried that Arab voters will not vote , thus losing his chances of winning , so he decided to resign and avoid it . hold a new general election .
again , organizing a prime minister election avoids intra-party challenges and creates the conditions for his re-election as prime minister . in recent days , there have been growing calls within the Labour Party for the replacement of Barack . Barack abruptly decided to resign and organize a prime minister election within 60 days to compete within the party in time . opponents create many problems that make them unable to organize competition in the short term .
Barak 's speech also upset the opposition . on the evening of the 9th the Likud group lashed out at Barak , calling it a violation of the law and threatening to submit a bill in Parliament to allow Netanyahu to participate in the prime minister 's election and vowing to try to dissolve the parliament as soon as possible . an early general election was passed to win the general election .
but there are signs that Likud 's plans are hard to come true , that Sharon doesn 't want Netanyahu back in the mountains , that most lawmakers don 't want to lose their jobs in the election , and that Barak decided to resign to continue his political career . a clever move is a smart thing to do , but it remains to be seen if we can finally get what we want .
